We illustrate here how our analysis work on two different examples.
% There are also three more hand-illustration examples in Apdix.
% The first example is an .
% The second examples is an data analysis algorithm used for data-base attack in real-world.
% The last example example is a path-sensitive algorithm, where the $\THESYSTEM$ analysis result is over-approximated. 
%Then we show our implementation of $\THESYSTEM$ and its experimental results on $18$ examples.
% More examples are in the supplementary material.
