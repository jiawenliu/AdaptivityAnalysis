We presented {\THESYSTEM}, a program analysis useful to provide an upper bound on the adaptivity of a data analysis under a specific data analysis model. This estimation can help data analysts to control the generalization errors of their analyses by choosing different algorithmic techniques based on the adaptivity. Besides, a key contribution of our works is the formalization of the notion of adaptivity for adaptive data analysis. 

In future work, we plan to address some of the limitations of {\THESYSTEM}. Our algorithm may over-estimate the adaptivity of a program, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:examples}, due to its path-insensitive nature. We plan in future work to explore the possibility of making {\THESYSTEM} path-sensitive. While we believe that in many concrete situations in data analysis requiring a concrete bound for loops is not a strong limitation, we also plan to explore how to add support for dynamic or unbounded loops. To extend our work in this direction we plan to use classical abstraction techniques, at the cost of a more imprecise estimation.
