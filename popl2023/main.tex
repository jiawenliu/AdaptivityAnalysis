\begin{abstract}
 Data analyses are usually designed to identify some property of the population from which the data are drawn, generalizing beyond the specific data sample. For this reason, data analyses are often designed in a way that guarantees that they produce a low generalization error. That is, to guarantee that the result of a data analysis run on a sample data does not differ too much from the result one would achieve by running the analysis over the entire population. 

An adaptive data analysis can be seen as a process composed by multiple queries interrogating some data, where the choice of which query to run next may rely on the results of previous queries. The generalization error of each individual query/analysis can be controlled by using an array of well-established statistical techniques. However, when queries are arbitrarily composed, the different errors can propagate through the chain of different queries and bring to high generalization error. To address this issue, data analysts are designing several techniques that not only guarantee bounds on the generalization errors of single queries, but that also guarantee bounds on the generalization error of the composed analyses. 
The total number of queries and the depth of the chain of queries are of great significance to guarantee the generalization error, when the composed data analyses are adaptive. 
The choice of which of these techniques to use, often depends on the process of the chain of queries that an adaptive data analysis can generate.   % Gap
% Unfortunately, this depth which relies on the program(implementation) itself is costly in human efforts, and how to statically obtain this information is not well studied to support data analysts.

In this work, \wq{we propose a new program property 'adaptivity' which measures the depth of chain of queries during the execution of program implementing the target data analysis. In correspondence, we design a program analysis that provides the upper bound on both the total number of queries and this 'adaptivity', when the input program is an implementation of an adaptive data analysis. These two measures can be then used by data analysts to select the right technique to control the generalization error in their adaptive data analysis design.} 
% Given an input program implementing an adaptive data analysis, our program analysis generates an upper bound on the total number of queries that the data analysis will run, and more interestingly also an upper bound on the depth of the chain of queries. 
% These two measures can be used to select the right technique to guarantee a bound on the generalization error of the data analysis. 
\wq{The key novelty of our program analysis lands in the representation of adaptivity in the form of a finite walk through a compact dependency graph between weighted variables in the input program, where the weight relies on the existing work of the reachibility bound. Additionally, the predicted 
 upper bound on adaptivity of our program analysis is based on path searching algorithm, which is proved sound with respect to the finite walk representation. 
 We implement our program analysis and show it can help to analyze the generalization error of several concrete data analyses with different adaptivity structures.
 }

% Our program analysis is based on an analysis of the dependency graph between different queries, representing the potential chain an adaptive data analysis may generate. We show how the proposed program analysis can help to analyze the generalization error of several concrete data analyses with different adaptivity structures.
