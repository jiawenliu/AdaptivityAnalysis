\end{thm}
proof Summary:
\\
1. for every two vertices $x, y$ with a walk $k_{x,y}$ from $x$ to $y$ on $\progG$, 
\\
2 if they are on the same SCC, 
\\
2.1 Then this walk must also be in this SCC.
(By the property that each SCC are single direct connected, otherwise they are the same SCC)
\\
2.2 By Lemma~\ref{lem:sound_adaptalg_scc}, $\qlen$ of this walk is bound by the longest walk of this SCC.
\\
2.3 The output of $\pathsearch(\progG)$ is greater than longest walk of a single SCC.
\\
3. if they are on different SCC. 
\\
3.1 Then this walk can be split into $n, 2 \leq n$ sub-walks, and each sub-walk belongs to a different SCC. (Also by the property of SCC)
\\
3.2 By Lemma~\ref{lem:sound_adaptalg_scc}, $\qlen$ of each sub-walk is bound by the longest walk of the SCC it belongs to.
\\
% we have a path
%  $p_{x,y} = (x, v_1, \cdots, y)$ by the $\kw{bfs}$ algorithm,
% and $adapt[\sccgraph(x)] + adapt[\sccgraph(v_1)] + \cdots + adapt[\sccgraph(y)] \geq \{\qlen(k_{x,y})\}$.
3.3 By line: in algorithm, the output of $\pathsearch(\progG)$ is greater than sum up the $\qlen$ of longest walk in every SCC that each sub-walk belongs to.
\\
4. Then we have
$\pathsearch(\progG(c)) \geq \progA(c)$.
\begin{proof}
  Taking arbitrary program $c \in \cdom$, let $\progG(c) = (\progV, \progE, \progW, \progF)$ be its 
  program based dependency graph.
  \\
  Taking an arbitrary walk $k_{x,y} \in \walks{(\progG)}$, with vertices sequence
  $(x, s_1, \cdots, y)$, it is sufficient to show:
  \[
    \qlen(k_{x,y}) = \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \pathsearch(\progG(c))
  \]
  By line:3 of $\pathsearch(\progG)$ algorithm defined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adpt_alg}, let $\kw{\sccgraph_1}, \cdots, \kw{\sccgraph_n}$ be all the strong connected components on $\progG$ with $0 \leq n \leq |\vertxs|$,
  where each $\kw{\sccgraph_i} = (\vertxs_i, \edges_i, \weights_i, \qflag_i)$,
  \\
  By line:5-6 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adpt_alg}, let $\kw{adapt_{scc}[\sccgraph_i]}$ be the result of $\pathsearch_{\kw{scc}}(\sccgraph_i)$ for each $\sccgraph_i$.
    % i.e.,
  % \[
  %   \]
  \\
  There are 2 cases:
  \caseL{$x, y$ on the same SCC}
  Let  $\sccgraph$ be this SCC where vertices $x$ and $y$ on, by Lemma~\ref{lem:sound_adaptalg_scc}, we know
  \[
    \qlen(k_{x,y}) \leq \max\{\qlen(k) | k \in \walks(\sccgraph)\} \leq \pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph)
  \]
%
By line:15 and line:18 in $\pathsearch(\progG)$ algorithm in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adpt_alg}, 
let $\kw{adapt}$ be the output value,
we know $\pathsearch(\progG(c))  = \kw{adapt} \geq \kw{adapt_{tmp}} \geq  \kw{adapt_{scc}(SSC)} $.
\\
i.e., 
\[
  \qlen(k_{x,y}) \leq \pathsearch(\progG(c)) 
  \]
This case is proved.
%
%
\caseL{$x, y$ on different SSC}
Let $\sccgraph_x, \sccgraph_1, \cdots, \sccgraph_m, \sccgraph_y, 0 \leq m$ be all the SCC this walk pass by, where each vertex in 
$(x, s_1, \cdots, s_n, y) $ belongs to a single SCC number. 
\\
By the property of SCC, we know every 2 SCCs are single direct connected. Then we can divide this walk into $m+2$ sub-walks:
\\
$k_x = (x, s_1, \cdots, s_{scc_x})$;
\\
$k_1 = (s_{scc_x}, \cdots, s_{scc_1})$;
\\
$\cdots$
\\
$k_y = (s_{scc_m}, \cdots, s_y)$;
\\
where $k_x \in \walks(\sccgraph_x), \cdots, k_y \in \walks(\sccgraph_y)$.
\\
By Lemma~\ref{lem:sound_adaptalg_scc}, we know for each walk $k_i$:
\[ \qlen(k_i) \leq \max\{\qlen(k_i) | k_i \in \walks(\sccgraph_i)\} \leq \pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph_i) = \kw{adapt_{scc}[\sccgraph_i]} \]
%
Then we have:
\[ 
  \qlen(k_{x,y}) = \qlen(k_x) + \qlen(k_1) + \cdots + \qlen(k_y) \leq 
  \kw{adapt_{scc}[\sccgraph_1]} + \kw{adapt_{scc}[\sccgraph_1]}  + \cdots + \kw{adapt_{scc}[\sccgraph_y]}
  \leq \kw{adapt}
  \]
, where $\kw{adapt}$ is the output of $\pathsearch(\progG)$.
This case is proved.

\begin{lem}[Soundness of $\pathsearch_{scc}$]
  \label{lem:sound_adaptalg_scc}
  For every program $c$, given its \emph{Program-Based Dependency Graph} $\progG$, if $\sccgraph$ is a strong connected sub-graph of $\progG$, then
  $\max\{\qlen(k) | k \in \walks(\sccgraph)\} \leq \pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph) $.
  %
  \[
    \forall c \in \cdom, \sccgraph \in \mathcal{Graph} \st \sccgraph \subseteq_{\kw{graph}} \progG(c)
    \implies 
    \max\{\qlen(k) | k \in \walks(\sccgraph)\} \leq \pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph) 
    \]
\end{lem}

ProofSummary:
\\
(1) for each node $x$ on SCC, by property of SCC, 
for every walk on SCC $k_{x, x} = (x, s_1, \cdots, x)$,
with set of unique vertex $\{v_1, \cdots, x\}$
there are $\paths(p_{x,x})$ on $\sccgraph$.
\\
(2) For every path $p_{x,x}^{i} = (x, v_1, \cdots, x) \in \paths(p_{x,x})$,  
$\kw{flowcapacity} (p_{x,x}^{i})$ is the maximum visiting times for every $v \in (x, v_1, \cdots, x)$, 
$\visit(s) (s_1, \cdots, x)) \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x,x}^{i})$;
\\
(3) $\kw{querynum}(p_{x,x}^{i})  * \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x,x}^{i}$)  $\geq\len(s | s \in ( s_1, \cdots, x) \land \qflag(s) = 1) =  \qlen(k)$,
\\
(4) Then, the $\max\limits_{p_{x,x}^{i} \in \paths(p_{x,x})} \geq \max\{\qlen(k_{x, x}) | k_{x, x} \in \walks(k_{x, x})\}$
\\
(5) Then,  $\max\{\kw{querynum}(p_{x,x}^{i})  * \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x,x}^{i}) | x \in \sccgraph \land {p_{x,x}^{i} \in \paths(p_{x,x})} \} 
\geq \max\{\qlen(k_{x, x}^i) |x \in \sccgraph \land  k_{x, x}^i \in \walks(k_{x, x})\}$
\\
(6) We also know by the property of SCC, $\forall x, y \in \sccgraph, $ let $k_{x, y}$ be arbitrary walk on $\sccgraph$,
 $\qlen(k_{x, y}) \leq \max\{\qlen(k_{x, x}^i) | k_{x, x}^i \in \walks(k_{x, x})\}$.
\\
(7) Then,$ \max\{\qlen(k_{x, x}^i) |x \in \sccgraph \land  k_{x, x}^i \in \walks(k_{x, x})\} \geq  \max\{\qlen(k_{x, y}^i) |x, y \in \sccgraph \land  k_{x, y}^i \in \walks(k_{x, y})\}$
\\
i.e., 
$ \max\{\qlen(k_{x, x}^i) |x \in \sccgraph \land  k_{x, x}^i \in \walks(k_{x, x})\} \geq  \max\{\qlen(k) | k\in \walks(\sccgraph)\} = \progA(\sccgraph)$.
\\
(8) We also know 
$\pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph) = \max\{\kw{querynum}(p_{x,x}^{i})  * \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x,x}^{i}) | x \in \sccgraph \land {p_{x,x}^{i} \in \paths(p_{x,x})} \} $ by the $\pathsearch_{scc}$ algorithm.
\\
Then we have
$\pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph) \geq \progA(\sccgraph)$
\\
\begin{proof}
  Taking arbitrary program $c \in \cdom$, let $\progG(c) = (\vertxs, \edges, \weights, \qflag)$ be its 
  program based dependency graph and $\sccgraph = (\sccV, \sccE, \sccW, \sccF)$ be an arbitrary sub SCC graph of $\progG$.
  \\
There are 2 cases:
\caseL{$\sccgraph$ contains no edge and only 1 vertex $v$, i.e., $|\edges| = 0 \land |\vertxs| = 1$}
%
In this case there is no walk in this graph, i.e., $\walks(\sccgraph) = \emptyset$.
\\
The adaptivity is $\qflag(v)$.
\\
This case is proved.
  %
  \caseL{$\sccgraph$ contains at least 1 edge and at least 1 vertex $v$, i.e., $1 \leq |\edges| \land 1 \leq |\vertxs|$}
%
  Taking arbitrary walk $k_{x,y} \in \walks{(\sccgraph})$, with vertices sequence
  $(x, s_1, \cdots, y)$, it is sufficient to show:
  \[
    \qlen(k_{x,y}) = \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph)
  \]
  By $\pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph)$ algorithm line 19, in the iteration where $x$ is the starting vertex,
  we know $\pathsearch_{scc}(\sccgraph) = \kw{r_{scc}} = \max(\kw{r_{scc}, \kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)}})$,
  then it is sufficient to show:
  $$
  \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)}.
  $$
  %
  Let  $\{v_1, \cdots, x\}$ be the set of all the distinct vertices of $k_{x,y}$'s vertices sequence $(x, s_1, \cdots, y)$, and 
  $(v_1, \cdots, x)$ be a subsequence containing all the vertices in $\{x, v_1, \cdots, y\}$.
  \\
  By the definition of walk,
 there  is a path $p_{x,y} $ from $x$ to $y$ with this vertices sequence: $(x, v_1, \cdots, y)$.
  \\
  By line:13 of the $\kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)}$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc},
  \\
  we know $\kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)} = r[x]$ and
  $r[x] = \max\{\kw{flowcapacity}(p) \times \kw{querynum}(p) | p \in \paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph)\}$,
  where $\paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph)$ is a subset of $\paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph)$, in which every path starts from $x$ and goes back to $x$.
  \\
  By the property of strong connected graph, we know in this case  $\paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph) \neq \emptyset$ and there are 2 cases, $x = y$ and $x \neq y$.
  \caseL{$x = y$}
  In this case, we know $p_{x, y} \in p \in \paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph)$,  then it is sufficient to show: 
  % $\len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y, v_1', \cdots, x) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq r[x]$.
  % \\
  % \\
  % Then we know 
  % \\
  $$ 
  \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y}) \times \kw{querynum}(p_{x, y} ) 
  $$
  %
  % , where $(p_{x, y} + p_{y, x})$ is the path $p_{x, y}$ concatenated by path $p_{y, x}$ and we know $(p_{x, y} + p_{y, x}) \in \paths(\sccgraph)$.
  \\
By line:7 and line:13 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}, we know $\kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y})$ is the maximum visiting times for every $v \in (x, v_1, \cdots, y)$, 
\\
we know for every $s$ in the vertices sequence of walk $k_{x,y}$, 
$\visit(s) (x, s_1, \cdots, y)  \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y})$
  \\
  Also by line:8 and line:13 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}, we know $\kw{querynum}(p_{x, y})$ is the number of vertices with $\qflag$ equal to $1$,
  \\
  Then we know 
  \\
  $\len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y}) \times \kw{querynum}(p_{x, y}) $
  \\
  This case is proved.
  \caseL{$x \neq y$}
  we also have a path start from $y$ and go back to $x$.
  % \todo{pass through the same vertices sequence.}
  \\
  Let $p_{y, x}$ be this path with vertices sequence $(y, v_1', \cdots, x)$, we have a path $p_{x,x}$, which is the path $p_{x, y}$ concatenated by path $p_{y, x}$ with vertices sequence $ (x, v_1, \cdots, y, v_1', \cdots, v_{m}', x)$, where $m \geq 0$.
  \\
  % Then we have a potential walk $k_{x,x}$ with vertices sequence $(x, s_1, \cdots, y) + (v_1', \cdots, x)$, and
  % we know $\qlen(k_{x,y}) \leq \qlen(k_{x,x})$.
  % Then, it is sufficient to show 
  % $$
  % \qlen(k_{x,x}) = \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y, v_1', \cdots, x) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)}
  % $$
  %
  % By line:13 of the $\kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)}$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc},
  % \\
  % we know $\kw{dfs(\sccgraph, x, visited)} = r[x]$ and
  % $r[x] = \max\{\kw{flowcapacity}(p) \times \kw{querynum}(p) | p \in \paths_{x,x}(\sccgraph)\}$.
  % \\
  Then in this case, it is sufficient to show: 
  % $\len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y, v_1', \cdots, x) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq r[x]$.
  % \\
  % \\
  % Then we know 
  % \\
  $$ 
  \len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, x}) \times \kw{querynum}(p_{x, x}) 
  $$
  %
  % \\
Since $\kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y} + p_{y, x})$ is the maximum visiting times for every $v \in (x, v_1, \cdots, y, v_1', \cdots, x)$, 
\\
By line:7 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}, we know $\kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y})$ is the maximum visiting times for every $v \in (x, v_1, \cdots, y)$, 
\\
we know for every $s$ in the vertices sequence of walk $k_{x,y}$, 
$\visit(s) (x, s_1, \cdots, y)  \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y})$
  \\
  Also by line:8 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}, we know $\kw{querynum}(p_{x, y})$ is the number of vertices with $\qflag$ equal to $1$,
  \\
  Then we know 
  \\
  $\len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, y}) \times \kw{querynum}(p_{x, y}) = r[y]$
  \\
  By line:13, we also know $r[x] = \max(r[x], r[v_{m}'] + \kw{flowcapacity}(p_{x, x}) \times \kw{querynum}(p_{x, x})$, and $r[y] \leq r[w_{m}']$
  then we know $r[y] \leq r[x]$, i.e., 
  $\len(s | s \in (x, s_1, \cdots, y) \land \qflag(s) = 1) \leq r[x]$
  \\
  This case is proved.
