\begin{abstract}
  Data analyses are usually designed to identify some property of the population from which the data are drawn, generalizing beyond the specific data sample. For this reason, data analyses are often designed in a way that guarantees that they produce a low generalization error.
  That is, they are designed so that the result of a data analysis run on a sample data does not differ too much from the result one would achieve by running the analysis over the entire population. 

  An adaptive data analysis can be seen as a process composed by multiple queries interrogating some data, where the choice of which query to run next may rely on the results of previous queries. 
  The generalization error of each individual query/analysis can be controlled by using an array of well-established statistical techniques.
  However, when queries are arbitrarily composed, the different errors can propagate through the chain of different queries and bring to a high generalization error. 
  To address this issue, data analysts are designing several techniques that not only guarantee bounds on the generalization errors of single queries, but that also guarantee bounds on the generalization error of the composed analyses. 
  The choice of which of these techniques to use, often depends on the chain of queries that an adaptive data analysis can generate.

  In this work, we consider adaptive data analyses implemented as while-like programs and we design a program analysis which can help with identifying which technique to use to control their generalization errors. 
  More specifically, we formalize the intuitive notion of \emph{adaptivity} as a quantitative property of programs. 
  We do this because the adaptivity level of a data analysis is a key measure to choose the right technique. 
  Based on this definition, we design a program analysis for soundly approximating this quantity.
  The program analysis generates a representation of the data analysis as a weighted dependency graph, where the weight is an upper bound on the number of times each variable can be reached, and uses a path search strategy to guarantee an upper bound on the adaptivity. 
  We implement our program analysis  and show that it can help to analyze the adaptivity of several concrete data analyses with different adaptivity structures.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% The topic, motivation, the importance of adaptivity 
Consider a dataset $X$ consisting of $n$ independent samples from some unknown population $\dist$.  How can we ensure that the conclusions drawn from $X$ \emph{generalize} to the population $\dist$?  Despite decades of research in statistics and machine learning on methods for ensuring generalization, there is an increased recognition that many scientific findings generalize poorly (e.g. 
\cite{Ioannidis05,GelmanL13}). While there are many reasons a conclusion might fail to generalize, one that is receiving increasing attention is \emph{adaptivity}, which occurs when the choice of method for analyzing the dataset depends on previous interactions with the same dataset~\cite{GelmanL13}.
%
 Adaptivity can arise from many common practices, such as exploratory data analysis, using the same data set for feature selection and regression, and the re-use of datasets across research projects.  Unfortunately, adaptivity invalidates traditional methods for ensuring generalization and statistical validity, which assume that the method is selected independently of the data. The misinterpretation of adaptively selected results has even been blamed for a ``statistical crisis'' in empirical science~\cite{GelmanL13}.

    \caption{Overview of our Adaptive Data Analysis model. We have a population that we are interested in studying, and a dataset containing individual samples from this population. The adaptive data analysis we are interested in running has access to the dataset through queries of some pre-determined family (e.g., statistical or linear queries) mediated by a mechanism. This mechanism uses randomization to reduce the generalization error of the queries issued to the data.}
    \label{fig:adaptivity-model-overview}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\end{figure}

A line of work initiated by \citet{DworkFHPRR15}, \citet{HardtU14} posed the question: Can we design \emph{general-purpose} methods that ensure generalization in the presence of adaptivity, together with guarantees on their accuracy?  The idea that has emerged in these works is to use randomization to help ensure generalization. Specifically, these works have proposed to mediate the access of an adaptive data analysis to the data by means of queries from some pre-determined family (we will consider here a specific family of queries often called "statistical" or "linear" queries) that are sent to a  \emph{mechanism} which uses some randomized process to guarantee that the result of the query does not depend too much on the specific
sampled dataset. This guarantees that the result of the queries generalizes well. This approach is described in Fig.~\ref{fig:adaptivity-model-overview}.  
This line of work has identified many new algorithmic techniques for ensuring generalization in adaptive data analysis, leading to algorithms with greater statistical power than all previous approaches. Common methods proposed by these works include, the addition of noise to the result of a query, data splitting, using sampling methods, etc. Moreover, these works have also identified problematic strategies for adaptive analysis, showing limitations on the statistical power one can hope to achieve. Subsequent works have then further extended the methods and techniques in this approach and further extended the theoretical underpinning of this approach, e.g.~\cite{dwork2015reusable,dwork2015generalization,BassilyNSSSU16,UllmanSNSS18,FeldmanS17,jung2019new,SteinkeZ20,RogersRSSTW20,DaganK22,Blanc23}.


A key development in this line of work is that the best method for ensuring generalization in an adaptive data analysis depends to a large extent on the number of \emph{rounds of adaptivity}, the depth of the chain of queries. As an informal example, the program $x \leftarrow q_1(D);y \leftarrow q_2(D,x);z \leftarrow q_3(D,y)$ has three rounds of adaptivity, since $q_2$  depends on $D$ not only directly because it is one of its input but also via the result of $q_1$, which is also run on $D$, and similarly,  $q_3$ depends on $D$ directly but also via the result of $q_2$, which in turn depends on the result of $q_1$. The works we discussed above showed that, not only does the analysis of the generalization error depend on the number of rounds, but knowing the number of rounds actually allows one to choose methods that lead to the smallest possible generalization error\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- we will discuss this further in Section~\ref{sec:overview}.

adding to the result of each query Gaussian noise scaled to the number of rounds. When instead  an adaptive data analysis uses a small number of rounds of adaptivity then a low generalization error can be achieved by using more specialized methods, such as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend data splitting mechanism or the reusable holdout technique from~\citet{DworkFHPRR15}.

This scenario motivates us to explore the design of program analysis techniques that can be used to estimate the number of \emph{rounds of adaptivity} that a program implementing a data analysis can perform. These techniques could be used to help a data analyst in the choice of the mechanism to use,
and they
could ultimately be integrated into a tool for adaptive data analysis such as the \emph{Guess and Check} framework by~\citet{RogersRSSTW20}. 

The first problem we face is \emph{how to formally define} a model for adaptive data analysis which is general enough to support the methods we discussed above and which would permit to formulate the notion of adaptivity these methods use. We take the approach of designing a programming framework for submitting queries to some \emph{mechanism} giving access to the data mediated by one of the techniques we mentioned before, e.g., adding Gaussian noise, randomly selecting a subset of the data, using the reusable holdout technique, etc. In this approach, a program models an \emph{analyst} asking a sequence of queries to the mechanism. The mechanism runs the queries on the data applying one of the methods above and returns the result to the program. The program can then use this result to decide which query to run next. Overall, we are interested in controlling the generalization error of the query results returned by the mechanism, by means of the adaptivity. 

The second problem we face is \emph{how to define the adaptivity of a given program}.
Intuitively, a query $Q$ may depend on another query $P$, if there are two values that $P$ can return which affect in different ways the execution of $Q$. 
For example, as shown in \cite{dwork2015reusable}, and as we did in our example in Fig.~\ref{fig:generalization_errors}(a), one can design a machine learning algorithm for constructing a classifier which first computes each feature's correlation with the label via a sequence of queries, and then constructs the classifier based on the correlation values. If one feature's correlation changes, the classifier depending on features is also affected.  
This notion of dependency builds on the execution trace as a \emph{causal history}. In particular, we are interested in the history or provenance of a query up until this is executed, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend we are not then concerned about how the result is used --- except for tracking whether the result of the query may further cause some other queries. This is because we focus on the generalization error of queries and not their post-processing. % 
To formalize this intuition as a quantitative program property,
we use a trace semantics recording the execution history of programs on some given input --- and we create a dependency graph, where the dependency between different variables (queries are also assigned to variables) is explicit and tracks which variable is associated with a query request. We then enrich this graph with weights describing the number of times each variable is evaluated in a program evaluation starting with an initial state. The adaptivity is then defined as the length of the walk visiting \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend most query-related variables on this graph\footnote{Formally, graphs will be well-defined only for terminating programs, this will guarantee that the walk is finite}. In other words, we define adaptivity as a \emph{quantitative form of program dependency}.

% \jl{ 
% To define adaptivity in our programming framework, we consider a weighted dependency graph over variables assigned in the program, where each edge is built by a semantics dependency relation between these variables. The dependency relation relies on the trace semantics of our programming framework which records the execution history of programs implementing adaptive data analysis. 
% %The novelty comes from the definition of relation of dependency between nodes, which consists of the edge in the graph. For now, we can think of each node is associated with a variable, storing the value assigned to its variable 
% }
% \jl{The general idea beneath this dependency relation is that modifying the value of some variable in an execution trace will later affect the following execution trace.
% By tracking if a variable is assigned by a query or not, we are able to distinguish whether one query may depend on the other.}

The third problem we face is \emph{how to estimate the adaptivity of a given program}. 
The adaptive data analysis model we consider and our definition of adaptivity suggest that for this task we can use a  program analysis that is based on some form of dependency analysis. This analysis needs to take into consideration:
1) the fact that, in general, a query $Q$ is not a monolithic block but rather it may depend, through the use of variables and values, on other parts of the program. Hence, it needs to consider some form of data flow analysis. 
2) the fact that, in general, the decision on whether to run a query or not may depend on some other value. Hence, 
 it needs to consider some form of control flow analysis.
 3) the fact that, in general, we are not only interested in whether there is a dependency or not, but in the length of the chain of dependencies. Hence, it needs to consider some quantitative information about the program dependencies. 

To address these considerations and be able to estimate a sound upper bound on the adaptivity of a program, 
we develop a static program analysis algorithm, named {\THESYSTEM}, which combines data flow and control flow analysis with reachability bound analysis~\cite{GulwaniZ10}. This combination gives tighter bounds on the adaptivity of a program than the ones one would achieve by directly using the data and control flow analyses or the ones that one would achieve by directly using reachability bound analysis techniques alone. We evaluate {\THESYSTEM} on a number of examples showing that it is able to efficiently estimate precise upper bounds on the adaptivity of different programs. 
All the proofs and extended definitions can be found in the supplementary material.

To summarize, our work aims at the design of a static analysis for programs implementing adaptive analysis that can estimate their rounds of adaptivity. Specifically, our contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A programming framework for adaptive data analyses where programs represent analysts that can query generalization-preserving mechanisms mediating the access to some data. 
    \item 
    A formal definition of the notion of adaptivity under the analyst-mechanism model,
    built on a variable-based dependency graph constructed using sets of program execution traces.
    \item 
    A static program analysis algorithm {\THESYSTEM} combining data flow, control flow and  reachability bound analysis in order to provide tight bounds on the adaptivity of a program.
    \item A soundness proof of the program analysis showing that the adaptivity estimated by {\THESYSTEM} bounds the true adaptivity of the program. 
    \item A prototype implementation of {\THESYSTEM} and an experimental evaluation showing its accuracy and efficiency of the adaptivity estimation on several examples.  
    We also provide an evaluation showing how the generalization error of several real-world data analyses can be effectively reduced by using the information provided by {\THESYSTEM}.

\subsection{Some results in Adaptive Data Analysis}
%\wq{I think we can move this subsection into appendix. Maybe just leave theorm 1.2 and 1.3}
%\jl{I don't agree}
In Adaptive Data Analysis, an \emph{analyst} is interested in studying some distribution $\dist$ over some domain $\univ$.  Following previous works~\cite{DworkFHPRR15,HardtU14,BassilyNSSSU16}, we focus on the setting where the analyst is interested in answers to \emph{statistical queries} (also known as \emph{linear queries}) over the distribution.  A statistical query is usually defined by some function $\qquery \from \univ \to [-1,1]$ (often other codomains such as $[0,1]$ or $[-R,+R]$, for some $R$, are considered).  The analyst wants to learn the \emph{population mean}, which is defined as 
$\qquery(\dist) = \ex{\sample \sim \dist}{\qquery(\sample)}$. 
%
We assume that the distribution $\dist$ can only be accessed via a set of \emph{samples} $\sample_1,\dots,\sample_n$ drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from $\dist$.  These samples are held by a mechanism $\mech(\sample_1,\dots,\sample_n)$ who receives the query $\qquery$ and computes an answer 
$\answer \approx \qquery(\dist)$.
%
The na\"ive way to approximate the population mean is to use the \emph{empirical mean}, which (abusing notation) is defined as 
$\qquery(\sample_1,\dots,\sample_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \qquery(X_i)$.
However, the mechanism $M$ can adopt some methods for improving the generalization error $| a- \qquery(\dist)|$.

In this work we consider analysts that ask a sequence of $k$ queries $\qquery_1,\dots,\qquery_k$.  If the queries are all chosen in advance, independently of the answers $a_1,\dots,a_k$ of each other, then we say they are \emph{non-adaptive}.  If the choice of each query $\qquery_j$ depends on the prefix $\qquery_1,\answer_1,\dots,\qquery_{j-1},\answer_{j-1}$ then they are \emph{fully adaptive}.  An important intermediate notion is \emph{$\qrounds$-round adaptive}, where the sequence can be partitioned into $\qrounds$ batches of non-adaptive queries.  Note that non-adaptive queries are $1$-round and fully adaptive queries are $k$-round adaptive.

We now review what is known about the problem of answering $r$-round adaptive queries.  
\begin{thm}[\cite{BassilyNSSSU16}] 
\label{thm:nonadapt-adapt}
\begin{enumerate}

\item For any distribution $\dist$, and any $k$ \emph{non-adaptive} statistical queries, with high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{probablity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability}\DIFaddend ,
% $$
$
\max_{j=1,\dots,k} | \answer_j - \qquery_j(\dist) | = O\left( \sqrt{\frac{\log k}{n}}  \right)
% $$
$.
%
\item For any distribution $\dist$, and  any $k$  \emph{$\qrounds$-round adaptive} statistical queries, with $\qrounds \geq 2$, with high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{probablity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability}\DIFaddend , the empirical mean (rounded to an appropriate number of bits of precision)\footnote{With infinite precision even two queries may give unbounded error, when the first query's result encodes the whole data.} satisfies:\\
% $$
$
\max_{j=1,\dots,k} | \answer_j - \qquery_j(\dist) | = O\left( \sqrt{  \frac{k}{n}}  \right)
% $$
$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
In fact, these bounds are tight (up to constant factors) which means that even allowing one extra round of adaptivity leads to an exponential increase in the generalization error, from $\log k$ to $k$.

\citet{DworkFHPRR15} and \citet{BassilyNSSSU16} showed that by using carefully calibrated Gaussian noise in order to limit the dependency of a single query on the specific data instance, one 
can actually achieve much stronger generalization error as a function of the number of queries, specifically.
\begin{thm}[\cite{DworkFHPRR15, BassilyNSSSU16}] \label{thm:gaussiannoise} For any distribution $\dist$, any $k$, any $\qrounds \geq 2$ and any \emph{$\qrounds$-round adaptive} statistical queries, if we answer queries with carefully calibrated Gaussian noise, with high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{probablity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability}\DIFaddend ,  we have:
\begin{center}
  $
\max_{j=1,\dots,k} | \answer_j - \qquery_j(\dist) | = O\left( \frac{\sqrt[4]{k}}{\sqrt{n}}  \right)
$  
\end{center}
\end{thm}
% Notice that in order to Theorem~\ref{thm:gaussiannoise} has different quantification in that the optimal choice of mechanism depends on the number of queries.  Thus, we need to know the number of queries \emph{a priori} to choose the best mechanism.
More interestingly, \citet{DworkFHPRR15}
also gave a refined bounds that can be achieved with different mechanisms depending on the number of rounds of adaptivity.   \begin{thm}[\cite{DworkFHPRR15}] \label{thm:gaussiannoise2} For any $r$ and $k$, there exists a mechanism such that for any distribution $\dist$, and any $\qrounds \geq 2$ any \emph{$\qrounds$-round adaptive} statistical queries, with high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{probablity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probability}\DIFaddend , it satisfies
\begin{center}
  $
\max_{j=1,\dots,k} | \answer_j - \qquery_j(\dist) | = O\left( \frac{r \sqrt{\log k}}{\sqrt{n}}  \right)
$  
\end{center}
\end{thm}
Notice that Theorem~\ref{thm:gaussiannoise2} has different quantification in that the optimal choice of mechanism depends on the number of queries {and number of rounds of adaptivity}.  This suggests that if one knows a good \emph{a priori upper bound on the number of rounds of adaptivity}, one can choose the appropriate mechanism and get a much better guarantee in terms of the generalization error.
As an example, as we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:generalization_errors}, if we know that an algorithm is 2-rounds adaptive, we can choose data splitting as {the} mechanism, while if we know that an algorithm has many rounds of adaptivity we can choose Gaussian noise. It is worth to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stress }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stressing }\DIFaddend that by knowing the number of rounds of adaptivity one can also compute a concrete upper bound on the generalization error of a data analysis. This information allows one to have a quantitative, a priori, estimation of the effectiveness of a data analysis. 
This motivates us to design a static program analysis aimed at giving good \emph{a priori} upper bounds on the number of rounds of adaptivity of a program. 

\input{examples/twoRounds-overview}


\subsection{ {\THESYSTEM} formally through an example.}
We illustrate the key technical components of our framework through a simple adaptive data analysis with two rounds of adaptivity.
% They are 1. the query while language for expressing a data analysis formally, 2. the definition of \emph{adaptivity} (\emph{adaptivity} is the short for \emph{rounds of adaptivity} used in the rest of the paper) based on the language semantics, and 3. the static analysis algorithm providing a sound upper bound on a data analysis' adaptivity.
% }
% \detailed{
% In "two rounds strategy" analysis, the analyst asks in total $k+1$ queries to the mechanism in two phases, the symbol $k$ is an input from the data analyst of this strategy and has no limit on the kind, which can be a constant, or a symbol or even an expression such as $(k+3)*2$.
% } 
%
In this analysis, an analyst asks $k+1$ queries to a mechanism in two phases.
In the first phase, the analyst asks $k$ queries and stores the answers that are provided by the mechanism. In the second phase, the analyst constructs a new query based on the results of the previous $k$ queries and sends this query to the mechanism. 
The mechanism is abstract here and our goal is to use static analysis to provide an upper bound on adaptivity to help choose the mechanism.
This data analysis assumes that the data domain $\univ$ 
contains at least $k$ numeric attributes 
(every query in the first phase focuses on one), which we index just by natural numbers.
The implementation of this data analysis in the language of {\THESYSTEM} is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a).

The {\THESYSTEM} language extends a standard while language\footnote{Programs components are labeled, so that we can uniquely identify every component.} with a query request constructor denoted $\query$.
 Queries have the form $\query(\qexpr)$, where $\qexpr$ is a special expression (see syntax in Section~\ref{sec:loop_language}) 
representing a function $\from \univ \to U$ on rows of an hidden database that is only accessible through the mechanisms. The domain $\univ$ of this function is the (arbitrary) domain of rows of the database. The codomain $U$ of this function is the query output space which, depending on the specific program, could be $[-1,1]$, $[0,1]$ or $[-R,+R]$, for some $R$. We use this formalization because we are interested in linear queries which, as we discussed in the previous section, compute the empirical mean of functions on rows.
 As an example, $x \leftarrow \query(\chi[j] \cdot \chi[k])$ computes an approximation, according to the used mechanism, of the empirical mean of the product of the $j^{th}$ attribute and $k^{th}$ attribute, identified by $\chi[j] \cdot \chi[k]$. Notice that we don't materialize the mechanism but we assume that it is implicitly run when we execute the query. 
 In Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a), the queries inside the while loop correspond to the first phase of the data analysis and compute the sum of the empirical mean of
the product of the $j$th attribute with the $k$th attribute. 
The query outside the loop corresponds to the second phase and computes an approximation of the empirical mean of the last attribute weighted by the sum of the empirical mean of the first $k$ attributes.


This example is intuitively 2-rounds adaptive since we have two clearly distinguished phases, and the queries that we ask in the first phase do not depend on each other (the query $\chi[j] \cdot \chi[k]$ at line $3$ only relies on the counter $j$ and input $k$), while the last query 
(at line 6) depends on the results of all the previous queries. 
However, capturing this concept formally is surprisingly challenging. The difficulty comes from the quantitative nature of this concept and how this quantitative nature interacts with data and control dependency. We describe how we capture it next. 
% \mg{this is weaker than it was in the previous submission.}

% % }
\subsubsection{Adaptivity definition}
\label{sec:adaptivity-informal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Details Below that might be useful when make passes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \detailed{To formally define the adaptivity, we build a directed graph representing the possible dependencies between queries of a program and we call this graph: execution-based dependency graph. The vertices represent the assigned program variables and the edges satisfy the dependency relations between vertices.   Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) is the execution dependency graph we build based on the "two rounds strategy program" in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a). In brief, the graph is built by collecting the assigned variables with labels of the target program as vertices, which are $a^0$, $j^1$,...$a^5$,$l^6$. We check if there is an edge between two vertices by our dependency relation over two labeled variables (defined in Section~\ref{sec:dep_adaptivity} ). This dependency relation relies on the execution of the program recorded by a trace generated by our trace semantics, which is the reason we call this graph "execution-based". 
% Intuitively from Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a), the query in the second phase (at line 6) depends on the query results in the first phase stored in $a$ at line 5, and the variable $a$ also relies on the queries at line 3. Correspondingly, we have two edges $(l^6, a^5)$ and $(a^5, x^3)$ in our execution-based dependency graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b). Besides, we also have special edge which is a circle, to track any variable being updated with its previous value recursively. For instance, the counter $j$ and the variable $a$ are updated based on previous values $k$ times in the first phase and we see two circle edges on $a^5$ and $j^4$.}

The central property we are after in this work is the \emph{adaptivity of a program}. We define formally this notion in three steps (details in Section~\ref{sec:adaptivity}). First, we define a notion of dependency, or better \emph{may-dependency}, between variables. To do this we take inspiration from previous works on dependency analysis and information flow control and we say that a variable \emph{may depend} on another one if changing the execution of the latter can affect the execution of the former. 
We can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a) that the value of the variable $l$, which corresponds to the result of the execution of the query in the second phase (in the command with label 6), is affected by the value of the variable $x$, which corresponds to the result of the execution of the query at line 3 in the first phase, via the variable $a$.
To formally define this notion of dependency, as in information flow control, we use the execution history of programs recorded by a trace semantics (see Definition~\ref{def:var_dep}).
% \mg{Please, double check that I refer to the right definition. }  

Second, we build an annotated weighted directed graph representing the possible dependencies between labeled variables. We call this graph \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend \emph{semantics-based dependency graph} to stress that this graph summarizes the dependencies we could see if we knew the overall behavior of the program. 
The vertices of the graph are the assigned program variables with the label of their assignments, edges are pairs of labeled variables which satisfy the dependency relations, weights are functions associated with vertices and describe the number of times the assignment corresponding to the vertex is executed when the program is run in a given starting state\footnote{In our trace semantics the state is recorded in the trace, so an initial state is actually represented by an initial trace. We will use this terminology in later sections.}, and the annotations, which we call \emph{query annotations}, are bits associated with vertices and describe if the corresponding assignment comes from a query (1) or not (0).
The \emph{semantics-based dependency graph} of the $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ program
we gave in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a) is described in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) (we use dashed arrows for two edges that will be highlighted in the next step, for the moment these can be considered similar to the other edges---i.e. solid arrows).
We have all the variables that are assigned in the program with their labels, and edges representing dependency relations between them. 
For example, we have two edges $(l^6, a^5)$ and $(a^5, x^3)$ describing the dependency between the variables assigned by queries. The vertices $l^6$ and $x^3$ are the only ones with query annotation $1$ (the subscript), since they are the only two variables that are in assignments involving  queries. Notice that the graph contains cycles---in this example it contains two self-loops. These cycles capture the fact that the variables $a^5$ and $j^4$ are updated at every iteration of the loop using their previous values. Cycles are essential to capture mutual dependencies like the ones that are generated in loops. Adaptivity is a quantitative notion, so capturing this form of dependencies is not enough. 
This is why we also use weights. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The weight of a vertex is a function that given an initial state returns a natural number representing

\DIFaddend % It is a function which takes an initial state, $\trace_0$ as input,

% Its subscript $0$ representing this is a non-query assignment.



% Besides, we also have special edge which is a circle, to track any variable being updated with its previous value recursively. 
% For instance, the loop counter $j$ and the variable $a$ are updated based on previous values $k$ times in the first phase and we see two circle edges on $a^5$ and $j^4$.

% \detailed{The existence of circle edge \jl{(there isn't a name 'circle edge', the terminology is cycle)}
%  allows our graph to express situation when a variable relies on its previous value recursively inside a while loop, but not show how many times of this reliance, which is necessary to define adaptivity. For instance, if we modify our two round example a little bit to make the query $query(\chi[j]\dot \chi[k])$ at line $3$ relies on its previous result to $query(\chi[j]\dot\chi[k] + x)$, then intuitively its adaptivity becomes $k+1$. To this end, we add quantitative information to our graph: weight on every vertex.

% Each vertex in this graph has a superscript representing its weight, and a subscript $1$ or $0$ telling if the vertex corresponds to a query or not. We will call this subscript a query annotation.

% The node $j^{4}:{}^{w_k}_0$ has as a subscript $0$ representing a non-query assignment.

So the adaptivity of the program in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a)  is $2$,

Third, we can finally define adaptivity using the semantics-based dependency graph. We actually define this notion with respect to an initial state $\tau$, since different states can give very different adaptivities.  
We consider 
% the longest walk  that visits each vertex $v$ of the semantics-based dependency graph no more than the value that the weight $w_v$ assign to $\tau$, and visits as many query nodes as possible. 
any  walk  that visits \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{any }\DIFaddend vertex $v$ of the semantics-based dependency graph no more than the value \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{specified by }\DIFaddend the vertex's weight $w_v$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{associates to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the initial state $\tau$, and that visits a maximal number of query vertices.
The number of query vertices visited is the adaptivity of the program with respect to $\tau$.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), assuming that $\tau(k) \geq 1$, we can see that the 
walk along the dashed arrows,  $l^{6} \to a^5 \to x^3 $ has two vertices with query annotation $1$, and we cannot find another walk having more than $2$ query vertices, although there is another walk, $l^{6} \to x^3 $, which has $2$ query vertices. So the adaptivity of the program in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a) with respect to $\tau$ is $2$. If we consider an initial state $\tau$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{so }\DIFaddend that $\tau(k)=0$ we have that the adaptivity with respect to $\tau$ is instead $1$.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Previous Version Above for Reference  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To compute statically a sound and accurate upper bound on the \emph{adaptivity} of a program $c$,
we design a program analysis framework named {\THESYSTEM} (formally in Section \ref{sec:algorithm}). 
The structure of {\THESYSTEM} (Fig.~\ref{fig:adaptfun}) reflects in part the definition of adaptivity we discussed. Specifically, {\THESYSTEM} is composed by two algorithms (the ones in dashed boxes in the figure), one for building a dependency graph, called \emph{estimated dependency graph}, and the other to estimate the adaptivity from this graph.  
The first algorithm generates the \emph{estimated dependency graph} using several program analysis techniques. Specifically,
 {\THESYSTEM} extracts the vertices and the query annotations by looking at the assigned variables of the program, it estimates the edges by using control flow and data flow analysis, and it estimates the weights by using symbolic reachability-bound analysis---weights in this graph are symbolic expressions over input variables. 
% This combined analysis allow us to obtain more accurate upper bounds than what we would obtain by using any of these single analysis technique in isolation.
The second algorithm estimates the
% longest 
walk which respects the weights and which visits the maximal number of query vertices.
%  as possible. 
The two algorithms together gives us an  upper bound on the program's \emph{adaptivity}.

For instance, 
%   the estimated weight $k$ of the vertex $x^{3}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(c) is a sound upper bound on the execution-based weight $w_k$ of vertex $x^{3}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), with the same starting trace $\trace$, $w_k(\trace) \leq\trace(k)$. $\trace(k)$ means getting the value of variable $k$ in the trace $\trace$. The soundness of this step is proved in Theorem~\ref{thm:addweight_soundness}.   
%
We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(c) the estimated dependency graph that our static analysis algorithm returns for the program $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a).
Vertices and query annotations are the same as the ones in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), simply inferred by scanning the program.
 Every edge in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) is precisely inferred by our combined data flow and control flow analysis, this is why Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(c) contains exactly the same edges.
The weight of every vertex is computed using a reachability-bound estimation algorithm which outputs a symbolic expression over the input variables, representing an upper bound on the number of times each assignment is executed.

% $w_k(\trace) \leq \trace(k)$. $\trace(k)$ means getting the value of variable $k$ in the trace $\trace$. The soundness of this step is proved in Theorem~\ref{thm:addweight_soundness}.}
For example, consider the vertex $x^{3}$, its weight is $k$ and this provides an upper bound on the value returned by the weight function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\lambda \trace. \rho(\trace)k$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \highlight{$\kw{lastVal}(\trace,k)$} \DIFaddend associated with vertex $x^{3}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) for any initial state. 
% Indeed,

% execution times of command $3$,
% we expect that this counts is at most the the loop iterations, i.e. $k$'s initial value from $\trace_0$.

The algorithm searching for the walk first finds a path $l^6:{}^1_1 \to a^5: {}^k_0 \to x^3: {}^k_1$, and then constructs a walk based on this path. Every vertex on this walk is visited once, and the number of vertices with query annotation $1$ in this walk is $2$, which is the upper bound we expect.
{It is worth noting here that $x^3$ and $a^5$ can only be visited once because there isn't an edge to go back to them, even though they both have the weight $k$}.  So the algorithm $\pathsearch$ computes the upper bound $2$ instead of $2k+1$. Note that $2$ is not always tight, for example when $k = 0$.
% In this sense, instead of simply computing the weighted length of this path ($2k+1$) as adaptivity, the algorithm $\pathsearch$ computes the upper bound $2$. Note that $2$ is not always tight, for example when $k = 0$.
% \todo{Can you double check if this is clear?}
% \mg{I think we should add a sentence to say that this bound is actually not always tight.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% that might be useful when others are making passes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \wq{As we have seen in the $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ example in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a), a program is expressed by labeled commands $c$. Our language supports the composition of labeled commands $c;c$, $[skip]^l$, the if condition $\eif([\bexpr]^l, c, c)$, the while command $\ewhile [\bexpr]^l \edo {c} $. The label $l$ records the location of this command, as a nature number $\mathbb{N}$ indicating the line number. Besides, it can also be $in$ or $ex$, used for annotating input variables and results and will not show up in labeled commands.} \wqside{Is it true that in and ex will not appear in the l in command?} 
%
% The boolean condition $b$ of the if and while commands is a standard boolean expression, which covers {\tt true} or {\tt false}, basic boolean connectives such as logical and logical or denoted by $\oplus_b$, logical negation $\neg$, and also comparison between arithmetic expressions $a \sim a$,  where $\sim$ stands for the basic operations such as $\leq,=,<,$ etc.  The arithmetic expression $a$ can be a constant $n$ denoting integer, a variable $x$ from some countable variable set $\mathcal{VAR}$, binary operation $\oplus_a$ such as addition, product, subtraction, etc, over arithmetic expressions, log and sign operation, minimal and maximum of two arithmetic expressions. An expression $e$ is then either a standard arithmetic expression or a boolean expression, or a list of expressions.
%
% \wq{As a reminder, the vertices of either the execution-based or program-based graphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) or Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(c) are assigned variables and these assigned variables come from our two assignment commands: the standard assignment $[\assign{x}{\expr}]^l$, and our main novelty, the query request assignment $[\assign{x}{q(\qexpr)}]^l$.  The query is specified by a query expression $\qexpr$, which contains the necessary information for a query request. The query expression can be either the normal form $\alpha$, or just an arithmetic expression $a$ to express constant queries, or $\chi[\aexpr]$ representing the values at a certain index $\aexpr$ in a row $\chi$ of the database. Besides, we also allow combined access to the database in query expressions by means of $\qexpr \oplus \qexpr$.} For example, $\chi[3] + 5$ represents a query which asks the value from the column 3 of each database raw $\chi$, adds 5 to each of these values, and then computes the average of these values.
% In reality, if a data analyst wants to ask a simple linear query which returns the first element of the row, they can simply use the command $ \assign{x}{q(\chi[1])}$ in their data analysis program.
Expressions include
standard arithmetic (with value $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup \{ \infty \}$) and boolean expression, ($\aexpr$ and $\bexpr$) and extended query expressions $\qexpr$.
A query expression $\qexpr$ can be either a simple arithmetic expression $a$, an expression of the form $\chi[\aexpr]$ where $\chi$ represents a row of the database  and  $\aexpr$ represents an index used to identify a specific attribute of the row $\chi$, a combination of two query expressions, $\qexpr \oplus_{a} \qexpr$, or a normal form $\qval$.
For example, the query expression $\chi[3] + 5$  denotes the computation that
obtains
the value in the $3$rd column of $\chi$ in one row and then adds $5$ to it.

Commands are the typical ones from while languages with an additional command $\assign{x}{\query(\qexpr)}$ for query requests which can be used to interrogate
 the database and compute the linear query corresponding to $\qexpr$.
Each command is annotated with a label $l$, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend we will use natural numbers as labels to record
the location of each command, so that we can uniquely identify them.
We also have a set \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of labels $\ldom$, a set }\DIFaddend $\mathcal{LV}$  of labeled variables (simply variables with a label), \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend a set $\cdom$ of all the programs.
We denote by $\mathbb{LV}(c)$ the set of labeled variables assigned in an assignment command in the program $c$.  
We denote by  $\qvar(c)$ the set of labeled variables that are assigned the result of a query in the program $c$.
 \DIFaddbegin \highlight{We provide the table of notations in Table~\ref{tb:notation} for quick reference.}
\DIFaddend 

% \mg{Please double check this notation.}


% In this the command, the query expression $\qexpr$ is sent to the database server as a request.
% Then the server will compute the average value of $\qexpr$ over each row of the hidden database $\chi$ and return us the result.
% For instance, when we execute the command $\assign{x}{\query(\chi[3] + 5)}$,
% the server will receive query request in form of $\chi[3] + 5$,
% then compute the average value of $\chi[3] + 5$ over each raw of $\chi$, and return the result to us. 
% The server is used as external API for computing the results over the hidden database $\chi$.

\subsection{ Trace-based Operational Semantics}
%DIF <   \wq{Our operational semantics uses the trace $\trace \in \mathcal{T}$ to track the history of the program execution, we use $\mathcal{T} $ for the set of traces. To be precise, the trace is a list of events and an event tracks the useful information about one step of the evaluation. When a program $c$ is evaluated in our operational semantics$\config{c, \trace} \to \config{c', \trace'} $, it starts with an initial trace $\trace$, evaluates to $c'$ , and along with the program evaluation, events are collected in the evaluation order and appended to $\trace$, and then we get the result trace $\trace'$. We can easily get the history of the evaluation of the program $c$ by looking at these newly added events in $\trace$ with respect to the initial trace $\trace$.  }

%DIF >  \highlight{Comment: A lot of notation is provided in section 3.1, some standard and some less-so. A table to summarize would be helpful for the reader to orient themselves during the rest of the paper. On a minor note: the combine operator (::) is used only once (in figure 5) which the concat operator (++) is used everywhere else (e.g., definitions 2 and 4) with singleton traces.}
We use a trace-based operational semantics tracking the history of program execution. The operational semantics is parameterized by a database that can be accessed only through queries. Since this database is fixed, we omit it from the semantics but it is important to keep in mind that this database exists and it is what allows us to evaluate queries.
A \emph{trace}
$\trace$ is a list of \emph{events} generated when executing specific commands. We denote by $\mathcal{T}$ the set of traces and we will use list notation for traces,
 where $[]$ is the empty trace, the operator $\traceadd$ combines an event and a trace in a new \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{event}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{trace}\DIFaddend , 
and the operator $\tracecat$ concatenates two traces. 
We have two kinds of events: \emph{assignment events} and \emph{testing events}. 
Each event consists of a quadruple,
and we use $\eventset^{\asn}$ and $\eventset^{\test}$ to denote the set of all assignment events and testing events, respectively.
% \begin{center}
% $ \begin{array}{lllll}
% \mbox{Event} 
% & \event & ::= & 
% {({x}, l, v, \bullet)} ~|~ { ({x}, l, v, \qval)}  ~|~{(\bexpr, l, v, \bullet)}  
% \\
% \end{array}$
% \end{center}
\begin{center}
  $ \begin{array}{lllll}
  \mbox{Event} 
  & \event & ::= & 
  ({x}, l, v, \bullet) ~|~ ({x}, l, v, \qval)  & \mbox{Assignment Event} \\
  &&& ~|~(\bexpr, l, v, \bullet)  & \mbox{Testing Event}
  \\
  \end{array}$
  \end{center}
An assignment event tracks the execution of an assignment  or a query request and consists of the assigned variable, the label of the command that generates it, the value assigned to the variable, and the normal form  $\qval$ of the query expression that has been requested, if this command is a query request, otherwise a default value $\bullet$.
A testing event tracks the execution of an if or while command and consists of the guard of the command, the label, the result of evaluating the guard, the last element $\bullet$. 
 We use the operator $\env (\trace) x$ to fetch the latest value assigned to  $x$ in the trace $\trace$, the operator
$\vcounter$ to count the occurrence of a labeled variable in the trace. \DIFaddbegin \highlight{ The function $\kw{lastVal}(\tau, x)$ mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:adaptivity-informal} can be 
expressed as $\lambda \trace. \env (\trace) x$. For any initial trace $\trace$, $\kw{lastVal}(\tau, x)$ returns the latest value of $x$ in $\trace$.
}
\DIFaddend We denote by $\tlabel(\trace) \subseteq \ldom$ the set of the labels occurring in $\trace$.
Finally, we use $\mathcal{T}_0(c) \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ to denote the set of \emph{initial traces}, the ones
which assign a value to the input variables. We use $\eventset$ to denote the set of all events.


The trace-based operational semantics is described in terms of a small step evaluation relation
$\config{c, \trace} \to \config{c', \trace}'$  describing how a configuration program-trace evaluates to another
configuration program-state. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The rules for the operational semantics are described }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Selected rules are shown }\DIFaddend in Fig.~\ref{fig:os}.
The rules for assignment and query generate assignment events, while the rules for while and if generate testing events. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The rules for the standard while language constructs correspond to the usual rules extended to deal with traces. 
}\DIFdelend We have relations $\config{\trace, \expr} \earrow v $  and $\config{\trace, \bexpr} \barrow v $  to evaluate expressions and boolean expressions, respectively. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Their definitions are in the supplementary material.
}\DIFdelend %   \mg{Can you please confirm that this is true?} Yes
The only rule that is non-standard is the $\textbf{query}$ rule. When evaluating a query, the query expression $\qexpr$ is first simplified to its normal form $\alpha$ using an evaluation relation $\config{\trace, \qexpr} \qarrow \qval$. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend normal form $\qval$ characterizes the linear query that is run against the database. The query result $v$ is the expected value of the function $\lambda \chi.\qval$ applied to each row of the dataset. We summarize this process with the notation $\query(\qval) = v$ in the rule $\textbf{query}$. 
Once the answer of the query is computed, the rules record all the needed information in the trace.  We will use $\to^*$ for the reflexive and transitive closure of $\to$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detailed Version in Explaining the Event %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% First of all, as the key component of the program evaluation history, an event $\event$ stores necessary information on the evaluation results of commands. Depending on the types of commands, there are two kinds of events: the assignment event which is generated in the standard assignment and query request assignment commands, and the testing event which is generated in an if or while command. Both assignment and testing events are quadruples, but store different contents. 
%\jl{
% The key component of the program evaluation history is the event $\event$,
% which stores necessary information on the evaluation results of commands.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detailed Version in Explaining the Assignment evaluation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The assignment event 
% targets the assignment so it needs to maintain the mapping between labeled assigning variable and the result assigned, to this end, the first three elements of the quadruple of an assignment event are the variable, the label, and the result $v$ of the assigned expression. Look at the rule $\textbf{assn}$ and rule $\textbf{query}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:os}, the result $v$ is different: in the standard assignment, $v$ is the evaluation result of the assigned expression $e$ by the standard expression evaluation $\config{\trace, \expr} \earrow v $; in the query request assignment, the query expression $\qexpr$ is evaluated to its normal form $\alpha$ by the query expression evaluation $\config{\trace, \qexpr} 
% \qarrow \qval$ and is sent to a hidden mechanism, $query(\alpha) = v$ means that the return result of this query represented by $\alpha$ from the mechanism is $v$. Another difference of the generated assignment events in these two rules lands in the last element of the quadruple, which stores the query information. In the rule $\textbf{query}$, the fourth element is the query normal form $\alpha$ which is sent to the mechanism, while in the standard assignment rule $\textbf{assn}$, we use $\bullet$ to show this event is not directly related to a query request.
% \jl{The assignment event is generated when evaluating an assignment command or query request. It stores the value assigned to each variable and tracks the query request.
% The first three elements are the variable, the label of this command, and the value assigned to this variable.
% The forth element is the normal form of a query expression, $\qval$ if this command is a query request, otherwise a default value $\bullet$.
% As in rule $\textbf{assn}$ and rule $\textbf{query}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:os}.
% When evaluating a query request, the query expression $\qexpr$ is first simplified to its normal form $\alpha$ by the evaluation rule $\config{\trace, \qexpr} \qarrow \qval$. 
% Then $\qval$ is sent to the hidden database on unknown server, which computes the query result and send back to us.
% This computation process is simplified into $\query(\qval) = v$ in the rule $\textbf{query}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detailed Version in Explaining the Expression Evaluation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \detailed{
% The expression evaluation $\config{\trace, \expr} \earrow v $ relies on the evaluation of arithmetic expressions $\config{\trace,\aexpr} \aarrow v $ and boolean expressions $\config{\trace, \bexpr} \barrow v $, they are standard and we leave The full rules in the appendix. The evaluation rules of query expressions are presented below.}
The query expression evaluation relation  $\config{\trace, \qexpr} \qarrow \qval$ is defined by the following rules which reduce a query expression to its normal form.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detailed Version in Explaining the Testing Event %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The testing event is generated when evaluating if and while commands. To record the control flow information, the first element of the event is the guard $b$ in both if and while rules $\textbf{if-t,if-f}$ and rule $\textbf{while-t, while-f}$. The third element then stores the evaluation results of this guard, either true or false. Since the guard can not be a query request, the last element is $\bullet$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Details for The If and While Evaluation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \detailed{The rules for if hand while both have two versions, when the guard evaluates to true and false, respectively. In these rules, the evaluation of the guard also generates testing event and our trace is updated as well. }
% The rules for if and while both have two versions, 
% when the boolean expressions in the guards are evaluated to true and false, respectively. 
% In these rules, the evaluation of the guard generates a testing event and the trace is updated as well by appending this event.
% The rule $\textbf{query}$ evaluates the argument of a query request to a normal form and obtain the answer $v_q$ of the query $\query(v)$ from the mechanism. 
% Then the trace expanded by appending the query expression $\query(v)$ with the current annotation $(l,w)$. 
% The rule for assignment is standard and the trace remains unchanged. The sequence rule keeps tracking the modification of the trace, and the evaluation rule for if conditional

\section{Definition of Adaptivity}
\label{sec:adaptivity}
 In this section, we formally present the definition of adaptivity for a given program. We first define a dependency relation between program variables, then define a semantics-based dependency graph, and finally look at the walk visiting the maximal number of query vertices in this graph. 
 % We first present the construction of the semantics-based dependency graph before the introduction of the formal definition of adaptivity. 

\subsection{May-dependency between variables}
\label{sec:dep}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detail Explanation of Variable May-Dependency and Motivation on How to define it %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \wq{we think the query $\query(\chi[2])$ (assigned variable $y^3$) may depend on the query $\query(\chi[1]$ (assigned variable $x^1$). 
  %  but vulnerable to queries request protected by differential privacy mechanisms. In our loop language, a query $q(e)$ represents a query request to the database through a mechanism, which add random noise to protect the return results. In this setting, the results of one query will be randomized due to the noise attached by the mechanism which fails the first candidate because witnessing the results of one query can no longer tells whether the change of the results comes from another query or the change of noise of the differential privacy mechanism. For example, suppose we have a program $p$ which requests two simple queries $q_1()$ and $q_2()$ with no arguments as follows.
%   \[
%   c_1 =\assign{x}{\query(\chi[2])} ;\assign{y}{\query(\chi[3] + x)}.
%   \]
%  $ c = \assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])} ; \assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}$,
%  and 
% Specifically, in the {\tt Query While} language, the query request is composed by two components: a symbol $\query$ representing a linear query type and 
% % an argument
% the query expression $\qexpr$ as an argument, 
% which represents the function specifying what the query asks. 
% From our perspective, $\query(\chi[1])$ is different from $\query(\chi[2]))$. Informally,  
%
% in this example: $c_1 = \assign{x}{\query(0)}; \assign{z}{\query(\chi[x])}$.
% This candidate definition works well 
% Nevertheless, the first definition fails to catch control dependency because it just monitors the changes to a query, but misses the appearance of the query when the answers of its previous queries change. For instance, it fails to handle $}
%       c_2 = \assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])} ; \eif( x > 2 , \assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}, \eskip )
%   $, but the second definition can. However, it only considers the control dependency and misses the data dependency. This reminds us to define a \emph{may-dependency} relation between labeled variables by combining the two definitions to capture the two situations.
%  $ p = \assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])} ; \assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}$. 
% This candidate definition works well with respect to data dependency. However, if fails to handle control dependency since it just monitors the changes to the answer of a query when the answer of previous queries returned change. The key point is that this query may also not be asked because of an analyst decision which depend on the answers of previous queries. An example of this situation is shown in program $p_1$ as follows.
% There are two possible situations that a query will be "affected" by previous queries' results,  
% either when the query expression directly uses the results of previous queries (data dependency), or when the control flow of the program with respect to a query (whether to ask this query or not) depends on the results of previous queries (control flow dependency). To this end, our assigned variable dependency definition has the following two cases.   
% {
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item One variable may depend on a previous variable if and only if a change of the value assigned to the previous variable may also change the value assigned to the variable.
%     \item One variable may depend on a previous variable if and only if a change of the value assigned to the previous variable may also change the appearance of the assignment command to this variable 
%     % in\wq{during?} 
%     during execution.
% \end{enumerate}
% }
%
%  The first case captures the data dependency. 
% For instance, in a simple program $c_1 =[\assign{x}{\query(\chi[2])}]^1 ;[\assign{y}{\query(\chi[3] + x)}]^2$, we think $\query(\chi[3] + x)$ (variable $y^2$) may depend on the query $\query(\chi[2]))$ (variable $x^1$), because the equipped function of the former $\chi[3] + x$ may depend on the data stored in x assigned with the result of $\query(\chi[2]))$. From our perspective, $\query(\chi[1])$ is different from $\query(\chi[2]))$. The second case captures the control dependency, for instance, in the program $
%       c_2 = [\assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])}]^1 ; \eif( [x > 2]^2 , [\assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}]^3, [\eskip]^4 )
%
% There are two possible situations that a query will be ``influenced'' by previous queries' results,
% where either the query request is changed when the results of previous queries are changed (data dependency),
% or the  query request is disappeared when the results of previous queries are changed (control dependency). In this sense, our formal dependency definition considers both the two cases:
We are interested in defining a notion of dependency between program variables since assigned variables are a good proxy to study dependencies between queries---we can recover query requests from variables associated with queries. We consider dependencies that can be generated by either data or control flow.
% as follows,
% \begin{enumerate}
For example, in the program 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$c_1 =[\assign{x}{\query(\chi[2])}]^1 ;[\assign{y}{\query(\chi[3] + x)}]^2$
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \[\DIFadd{c_1 =}[\DIFadd{\assign{x}{\query(\chi[2])}}]\DIFadd{^1 ;}[\DIFadd{\assign{y}{\query(\chi[3] + x)}}]\DIFadd{^2}\]
\DIFaddend the query $\query(\chi[3] + x)$  depends on the query $\query(\chi[2]))$ through a \emph{value dependency} via  $x^1$.
% ), because $\chi[3] + x$ may depend on the data stored in x assigned by the result of $\query(\chi[2]))$. 
% From our perspective, $\query(\chi[1])$ is different from $\query(\chi[2]))$.
% \\
% (2). One query may depend on a previous query if and only if a change of the value returned
%     to the previous query request may also change the appearance of this query quest.
%     This captures the control influence.
Conversely, in the program
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$c_2 = [\assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])}]^1 ; \eif( [x > 2]^2 , [\assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}]^3, [\eskip]^4 )$ 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \[\DIFadd{c_2 = }[\DIFadd{\assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])}}]\DIFadd{^1 ; \eif( }[\DIFadd{x > 2}]\DIFadd{^2 , }[\DIFadd{\assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}}]\DIFadd{^3, }[\DIFadd{\eskip}]\DIFadd{^4 )}\] 
\DIFaddend the query $\query(\chi[2])$  depends on the query $\query(\chi[1])$ via the \emph{control dependency} of the guard of the if command involving the labeled variable $x^1$.
% \end{enumerate}
% \\
% \\
% The first case captures the data dependency. 
% For instance, in a simple program $c_1 =[\assign{x}{\query(\chi[2])}]^1 ;[\assign{y}{\query(\chi[3] + x)}]^2$, we think $\query(\chi[3] + x)$ (variable $y^2$) may depend on the query $\query(\chi[2]))$ (variable $x^1$), because the equipped function of the former $\chi[3] + x$ may depend on the data stored in x assigned with the result of $\query(\chi[2]))$. From our perspective, $\query(\chi[1])$ is different from $\query(\chi[2]))$.
% \\
% The second case captures the control dependency.
% For instance, in the program
% $c_2 = [\assign{x}{\query(\chi[1])}]^1 ; \eif( [x > 2]^2 , [\assign{y}{\query(\chi[2])}]^3, [\eskip]^4 )$, 
% we think the query $\query(\chi[2])$ ( or the labeled variable $y^3$) may depend on the query $\query(\chi[1])$ (via the labeled variable $x^1$). 
% \jl{ 
% Since both \emph{influences} are passing through variables, we choose to define the \emph{may-dependency}
% relation over all labeled variables, and then recover the query requests from query-associated variables, $\qvar(c)$.
% It relies on formal observation of the \emph{influences} via events in Def.~\ref{def:diff} and the \emph{may-dependency} between events in Def.~\ref{def:event_dep}.
% }

To define dependency between program variables we will consider two events that are generated from the same command, hence they have the same variable name or boolean expression and label, but have either different values or different query expressions.

We can now define when an event \emph{may depend} on another one in Definition~\ref{def:event_dep}\footnote{We consider here dependencies between assignment events. This simplifies the definition and is enough for the stating the following definitions. The full definition is in the supplementary material.}.

There are several components in Definition~\ref{def:event_dep}. The part with label (2a) requires that $\event_1$ and $\event_1'$ differ in their values ($\diff(\event_1, \event_1')$).
The next two parts (2b) and (2c) capture the value dependency and control dependency, respectively.
As in the literature on non-interference, and following~\cite{Cousot19a}, we formulate these dependencies as relational properties, in terms of two different traces of execution. 
We force these two traces to differ by using the event $\event_1$ in one and $\event_1'$ in the other. 
For the value dependency we check whether the change also creates a change in the value of $\event_2$ or not. We additionally check that the two events we consider appear the same number of times in the two traces - this to make sure that if the events are generated by assignments in a loop, we consider the same iteration. 
For the control dependency we check whether the change of the value in the assignment of event $\event_1$ affects the occurrence of event $\event_2$ or not. 
For this we require the presence of a test event whose value is affected by the change in $\event_1$
in order to guarantee that the computation goes through a control flow guard.
Similarly to the previous condition, we additionally check that the two test events we consider appear the same number of times in the two traces.

In the running example in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), given the initial trace $[ (k, \lin, 1, \bullet)]$,
the program execution generates an
event $\event_1 = (x, 3, v_1, \chi[0] \cdot \chi[1])$ for
$\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\chi[j] \cdot \chi[k])} }^{3}$,
and another event
$\event_2 = (l, 6, v_2, \chi[1] \cdot v_1 )$ for
$\clabel{\assign{l}{\query(\chi[k] \cdot a)} }^{6}$.
To check a may-dependency, we replace $\event_1$ with another event $\event_1' = (x, 3, v_1', \chi[0] \cdot \chi[1])$
where $v_1 \neq v_1'$.
We then continue to execute the program. The $6^{th}$ command generates $\event_2 = (l, 3, v_2, \chi[1] \cdot v_1' )$.
Since $\pi_4(\event_2) \neq_1 \pi_4(\event_2')$, we have  $\diff(\event_2, \event_2')$ according to Definition~\ref{def:diff} and then the dependency relation $\eventdep(\event_1, \event_2, \kw{twoRounds(k)})$.


 The dependency relation to variables can be extended by considering all the assignment events generated during the program's execution. Notice two variables can be the same in the following definition, this allows us to capture self-dependencies.

%Notice that in the definition above we can also have that the two variables are the same, this allows us to capture self-dependencies.

%Going back to the running example in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a), we have already discussed how  $\event_1 = (x, 3, v_1, \chi[0] \cdot \chi[1])$ and $\event_2 = (l, 6, v_2, \chi[1] \cdot v_1 )$ are in the event may-dependency relation. Moreover, we have that $x^3$ and $l^6$ are in the variable may-dependency relation by Definition~\ref{def:var_dep}.

\subsection{Semantics-based Dependency Graph}
\label{sec:design_choice}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Detailed Version in Introducing The Dependency Graph %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% we formally define the semantics-based dependency graph as follows. There are some notations used in the definition. The labeled variables of a program $c$  
% is a subset of the labeled  variables $\mathcal{LV}$, denoted by $\lvar(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{VAR} \times \mathcal{L}) \subseteq \mathcal{LV}$.
% \wq{I think LV(c) means all the labeled assigned variables, because in Fig.3.b, j2 is not in the graph so j2 is not in LV(tworounds), please verify. If so, maybe LV(c) is not a good name, people may think it means all the label variables, instead of just assigned ones.}
% The set of query-associated variables (in query request assignments) for a program $c$ is denoted as $\qvar(c)$, where $\qvar: \cdom \to 
% \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{LV})$. The set of initial traces of a program $c$ is a subset of the  trace universe $\trace$, in which every initial trace contains the value for all the input variables of $c$. For instance, the initial trace $\trace_0$ contains the value of input variable $k$ in the $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ example.
\begin{defn}[Semantics-based Dependency Graph]
  \label{def:trace_graph}
  Given a program ${c}$,
  its \emph{semantics-based dependency graph} 
  $\traceG({c}) = (\traceV({c}), \traceE({c}), \traceW({c}), \traceF({c}))$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is defined }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \highlight{consists of four components: vertices are all the

  A semantics-based dependency graph $\traceG({c})= (\traceV({c}), \traceE({c}), \traceW({c}), \traceF({c}))$ is \emph{well-formed} if and only if $ \{x^l \ |\ (x^l,w)\in \traceW({c})\} = \traceV({c}) $.
  }
  \end{defn}
We can now define the \emph{semantics-based dependency graph} of a program $c$ in Definition~\ref{def:trace_graph}. We want this graph to combine quantitative reachability information with dependency information. 
% For instance, the initial trace of $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ example contains the initial value of the input variable $k$.

 Vertices and query annotations are just read out from the program $c$. We have an edge in $\traceE(c)$ if we have a may-dependency between two labeled variables in $c$.
% For the dependency graph of our running example in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b),
% the subscript in vertices $x^3$ and $l^6$ is $1$ because they both come from query requests.
% There is a directed edge from $x^3$ and $l^6$ because we identify the variable may-dependency relation, $\dep(x^3, l^6, \kw{twoRounds(k)})$ according to Definition~\ref{def:var_dep}.
A weight function $w \in \traceW(c)$ is a function that for every starting trace $\trace_0 \in \mathcal{T}_0(c)$ 
gives the number of times the assignment of the corresponding vertex $x^l$ is visited. Notice that weight functions are total and with range $\mathbb{N}$. This means that if a program $c$ has some non-terminating behavior, the set $\traceW(c)$ will be empty. 
To rule out this situation, we consider as well-formed only graphs with a weight for every vertex. 
%\highlight{This is also because programs that have non-terminating behaviors do not have the intuitive adaptivity.}
%MG: I don't think this sentence is clear
In the rest of the paper we  implicitly consider only well-formed semantics-based dependency graphs. 

% Going back to the example in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), the vertices $a^0$, $j^1$ and $l^6$ have weight function $\lambda \trace \st 1$ because commands $0, 1$ and $6$ are executed only once, given any arbitrary initial trace.
% The vertices corresponding to commands inside the loop body have weight function $\lambda \trace \st \env(\trace) k$ because they  will be executed the same number of times as the loop iteration times.



  \subsection{Adaptivity of a Program}
  \label{sec:sematnic_adaptivity}
 This notion of adaptivity is formulated in terms of an initial trace, specifying the value of the input variables, and of the walk on the graph $\traceG({c})$ which has the largest number of query requests.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), $\lambda \trace_0 \st (l^6 \to x^3)$ is a walk with two vertices and where each vertex is visited only once. 
With the assumption that $k \geq 1$, $\lambda \trace_0 \st (l^6 \to {a^5 \to a^5 \to \ldots} \to x^3)$ is a walk where the vertex $a^5$ is visited $\env(\trace) k$ times.
However, $\lambda \trace_0 \st (l^6 \to a^5 \to x^3 \to x^3)$ is not a walk because there is no edge from $x^3$ to $x^3$.
%\underbrace{a^5 \to a^5 \to \ldots}_{\env(\trace) k} 
The formal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{defintion }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{definition }\DIFaddend of a walk is the following:
\begin{defn}[Walk]
\label{def:finitewalk}
Given a well-formed program $c$ with its semantics-based dependency graph $\traceG({c}) = (\traceV, \traceE, \traceW, \traceF)$, a \emph{walk} $k$ is a function that maps an initial trace $\trace_0$ to a sequence of vertices $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$
for which there is a sequence of edges $(e_1 \ldots e_{n - 1})$  satisfying
\begin{itemize}
\item $e_i = (v_{i},v_{i + 1}) \in \traceE$ for every $1 \leq i < n$,
\item and $v_i$ appears in $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$ at most $w_i(\trace_0)$ times for every $v_i \in \traceV$ and $(v_i, w_i) \in \traceW$.  
\end{itemize}
% $k(\trace_0) = (v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$
% and w
We denote by $\walks(\traceG(c))$
the set of all the walks $k$ in $\traceG(c)$.
\end{defn} 
Because for the adaptivity
% is intuitively 
we are interested in the dependency between queries,
we calculate a special ``length'' of a walk, the \emph{query length},  by counting only the vertices
corresponding to queries.
\begin{defn}[Query Length]
\label{def:qlen}
Given 
the semantics-based dependency graph $\traceG({c})$ of a well-formed program $c$,
 and a \emph{walk} 
 $k \in \walks(\traceG(c))$, 
%  with vertex sequence $(v_1, \ldots, v_{n})$, 
the \emph{query length} of $k$ is a function $\qlen(k):\tdom_0(c) \to \mathbb{N}$ that 
given an initial trace $\trace_0\in \tdom_0(c)$ 
gives
the number of vertices that correspond to query variables in the vertex sequence of $k(\trace_0)$.
It is defined as follows.
\begin{center}
   $
  \qlen(k) = \lambda \trace_0 \st |\big( v \mid v \in (v_1, \ldots, v_{n}) \land (v, 1) \in \traceF(c) 
%   \land
%   k \in \walks(\traceG(c)) 
  \land k(\trace_0) = (v_1, \ldots, v_{n}) \big)|,
$
\end{center}
where the notation $| (\ldots) |$ gives the number of vertices in a sequence.
\end{defn}
% \todo{Referring the running example}

% Under the assumption that $k \geq 1$, both walks $\lambda \trace_0 \st (l^6 \to x^3)$ and  $\lambda \trace_0 \st (l^6 \to \underbrace{a^5 \to a^5 \to \ldots}_{\env(\trace) k} \to x^3)$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b) have query length $\lambda\trace_0 \st 2$ because only
% vertices $x^3$ and $l^6$ come from query requests.

 We can now define the adaptivity of a well-formed program as follows.
\begin{defn}
    [Adaptivity of a Program]
    \label{def:trace_adapt}
    Given a well-formed program ${c}$, 
    its adaptivity $A(c)$ is a function 
    $A(c) : \tdom_0(c)\to \mathbb{N}$
    defined as follows.
\begin{center}
$
    A(c) = \lambda \trace_0 \st \max \big 
    \{ \qlen(k)(\trace_0) \mid k \in \walks(\traceG(c)) \big \} 
$
\end{center}
\end{defn}
% Again, we define the adaptivity by considering only well-formed semantics-based dependency graphs. In Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b), the two dotted edges represent a finite walk with maximal query length, since it contains the only two query requests.
%   Each query request can be visited at most once, and so the adaptivity of this program is $\lambda \trace_0  \st 2$.

\section{The Adaptivity Analysis Algorithm - {\THESYSTEM}}
\label{sec:algorithm}
In this section, we present our program analysis {\THESYSTEM} for
computing an upper bound on the \emph{adaptivity} of a given program
$c$.
%
%% \remove{The high level idea behind {\THESYSTEM} is to first build
%% an \emph{estimated dependency graph} \progG(c) of a program $c$
%% (Section~\ref{sec:alg_weightedgegen}) which overapproximates the
%% semantics-based dependency graph in two dimensions: it
%% overapproximates the dependencies between assigned variables (Section~\ref{sec:alg_edgegen}), and, it
%% overapproximates the weights (Section~\ref{sec:alg_weightgen}). Then, {\THESYSTEM} uses a custom algorithm to estimate the 
%% walk of maximal query length on this graph, providing in this way an upper bound on the adaptivity of the
%% program.} 
%\highlight{ 
 The high-level idea behind {\THESYSTEM} is the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item construct
    an \emph{estimated program dependency graph} \progG(c) of a program $c$;
    \item use a reachability-bound algorithm to estimate the weight of every vertex in the graph;
    \item  use an algorithm, which we call AdaptBD, to estimate an upper bound on the number of queries in the walk over the weighted dependency graph that visits \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend most query vertices. %This in turns gives us an upper bound to the adaptivity. 
  \end{enumerate}
  The \emph{estimated dependency graph} overapproximates the
  semantics-based dependency graph in two dimensions: it
  overapproximates the dependencies between assigned variables (Section~\ref{sec:alg_edgegen}), and, it
  overapproximates the weights (Section~\ref{sec:alg_weightgen}). Thanks to this, 
 we prove the upper bound provided by AdaptBD is a sound upper bound
  over the semantic-based adaptivity in Definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt} in Theorem~\ref{thm:adaptalg_soundness}.

\subsection{Weighted Dependency Graph Construction}
Given a program $c$, the set of vertices $\progV(c)$ and query annotations $\progF(c)$ of the \emph{estimated dependency graph} can be computed by simply
scanning the program $c$. These sets can be computed precisely and correspond to
the same sets in the semantics-based dependency graph.
This means that $\progG(c)$ has the same underlying vertex structure as 
the semantics-based graph $\traceG(c)$. The differences will be in the sets of edges and weights.

%% % Each edge is annotated by a constraint $dc \in \dcdom^{\top}$, which is generated from the command with label $l$.
%% % This constraint describes the abstract execution of the command with $l$. 
%% % The edge set is constructed in three steps summarized as follows (with detail in Apdix.).

\subsubsection{Edge Construction}
\label{sec:alg_edgegen}
The set of edges $\progE(c)$ is built using a {\em feasible data-flow analysis}, 
a data flow analysis over 
our query language, combined with a reaching definition analysis.
The reaching definition analysis computes a set $\live(l, c)$ of reachable 
variables at line $l$ in the program $c$.
%This analysis helps removing redundent edges 
%in the data-flow analysis. 

The {\em feasible data-flow analysis} computes for every pair \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of variables }\DIFaddend $x^i, y^j \in \lvar(c)$
 whether there is a flow from $x^i$ to $y^j$.

  Given a program ${c}$ and two labelled variables  $ x^i, y^j \in \lvar_{{c}}$, if $x$ at location $i$ may depend on

  \begin{proof}
      The proof proceeds by induction. It is sufficient to consider two cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item  $x^i$ directly affects the execution of $y^j$, either through an assignment or a control flow command;
      \item there exists another labelled variable $z^l$ with \emph{variable May-Dependency} relation on $x^i$ and 
      $z^l$ directly flows to $y^j$, where the \emph{variable May-Dependency} relation between $x^i$ and $z^l$ implies a ``sub $\flowsto$-chain'' from $x^i$ to $z^l$.
    \end{enumerate}
The first case can be shown by case analysis, for the second case one can use the inductive hypothesis and the fact that there is an event corresponding to  $z^l$ in the trace. The full proof is in the supplementary material, Appendix~C.1.

\subsubsection{Weight Estimation}
\label{sec:alg_weightgen}

The weight of every vertex is obtained as an upper bound on 
the number of times the corresponding command can be executed,
which can be statically estimated by \emph{reachability-bound analysis}~\cite{GulwaniZ10}.
Our reachability-bound analysis adapts ideas from previous works~\cite{ZulegerGSV11,SinnZV14,sinn2017complexity} 
to our query language setting. First, we need to 
construct an abstract transition graph $\absG(c)$ of a program $c$, a
graph with the set of labels of program points in $c$  (including a 
label $\lex$ for the exit point) as the set of
vertices $\absV(c)$, and with the set of transitions in $c$ as the set of
edges $\absE(c)$. Each edge of the graph is annotated with either
the symbol $\top$, a boolean expression or a \emph{difference
constraint}~\cite{sinn2017complexity}. A difference constraint is an
inequality of the form $x' \leq y + v$ {or $x' \leq v$}
where $x, y$ are variables and $v \in \constdom$ is a symbolic
constant: either a natural number, the symbol $\infty$, an input
variable or a symbol $Q_m$ representing a query request. Difference constraints describe
quantitative conditions that are guaranteed by the execution of the command with
the corresponding label. We denote by
$\dcdom$ the set of difference constraints.

%% \remove{The set $\progW(c)$ of weights for the estimated dependency graph is estimated from 
%% the Abstract Transition Graph $\absG(c)$ of $c$ using \emph{reachability-bound analysis}~\cite{GulwaniZ10}.
%%  Specifically, we estimate as the weight of a vertex with label $l$ a symbolic upper bound on the 
%%  execution times of the command with label $l$ obtained by reachability-bound analysis. 
%%  These symbolic upper bounds are expressions with the input variables as free variables, 
%%  hence they correspond to the weight functions in the semantics-based dependency graphs. 
%% Our reachability-bound algorithm adapts to our setting ideas from 
%% previous work~\cite{ZulegerGSV11,SinnZV14,sinn2017complexity}.
%% Specifically, it provides an upper bound on the number of times every command can be executed by
%%  using three steps.
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item This step assigns to each edge  $l \xrightarrow{dc} l'\in \absE(c)$ a \emph{local bound} as follows. We look at the strongly connected components of $\absG(c)$. If the edge does not belong to any strongly connected components, then the local bound is $1$, representing the fact that the edge is not in a loop and so it gets executed at most once. If the edge belongs to a strongly connected component and one of the variables $x$ in $dc$ decreases, then the local bound is $x$. Otherwise, if the edge belongs to a strongly connected component and there is a variable $y$ that decreases in the difference constraint of some other edge, and if by removing this other edge, the original edge does not belong anymore to the strongly connected components of $\absG(c)$, then the local bound is $y$. Otherwise, the local bound is $\infty$. Notice that the output is either a symbolic constant in $\constdom$ or a variable that is not an input variable.
%% % assigns a local bound $c$ ($c \in \constdom \cup \mathcal{V}$), if $c$ decreases in $dc$.
%% \item This step aims at determining the \emph{reachability-bound} $\absclr(e, c)$ of every edge $e \in \absE(c)$. Every bound is a symbolic expression from the set $\mathcal{A}_{in}$ built out of symbols in $\constdom$ and the operations $+, *, \max$. For every edge, if the local bound of this edge computed at the previous step is a symbol in $\constdom$ then this is already the reachability-bound. If instead the local bound of the edge is a variable $y$ which is not an input variable, this step will eliminate it and replace it with a symbolic expression. In order to do this, this step will compute two quantities: first, it will recursively sum the reachability-bounds of all the edges whose difference constraint may increment the variable $y$, plus the corresponding increment; second, it will recursively sum the reachability-bounds of all the edges whose difference constraint may reset the variable $y$ to a (symbolic) expression that doesn't depend on it, multiplied by the maximal value of this symbolic expression. The sum of these two quantities provides the symbolic expression that is an upper bound on the number of times the edge can be reached.

The set $\progW(c)$ of weights for the estimated dependency graph is estimated from 
the Abstract Transition Graph $\absG(c)$ of $c$ using reachability-bound analysis.
 Specifically, we use the weight of a vertex with label $l$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\DIFaddend the \emph{symbolic upper bound} on the 
 execution times of the command with label $l$ that we obtain using our reachability-bound analysis. 
 These symbolic upper bounds are expressions with the input variables as free variables, 
 hence they can be used to upper bound the weight functions of the semantics-based dependency graphs.
We denote the reachability-bound of an edge $e = (l, dc, l') \in \absE(c)$ as $\absclr(e, c)$.
More details are in the supplementary material.% Fig.~\ref{fig:abscfg_tworound}(c) has the bounds $\absclr(e, c)$ for each edge $e$.

\begin{defn}[Weight Estimation]
  \vspace{-0.1cm}
 \label{def:adaptfun-weight}
The estimated weight set $\progW(c)$ of program $c$ is a set of pairs $\progW(c) \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{LV} \times \constdom)$.
Each pair maps
a vertex $x^l \in\progV(c)\subseteq  \lvar(c)$ to a symbolic expression over $\constdom$,
% is formally computed
as follows.
 $
 \progW(c) \triangleq
 \left\{ (x^l, \hat{w}) 
\mid
x^l \in \progV(c) 
\land 
\hat{w} = 
\sum\left\{ \absclr(e, c) \middle\vert e \in \absE(c) \land e = (l, \_, \_) \right\}
\right\}.
$
\end{defn}
%
%Notice that $\hat{w} \in \constdom$ is an expression over symbols in $\constdom$. In particular, it may contain the input variables and so it may effectively be used as a function of the input - and capture loop bounds in terms of these inputs.
% We guarantee that $\hat{w}$ for $x^l \in \progV(c)$ is a sound upper bound of 
% the weight for the same vertex $x^l$ in the program's semantics-based dependency graph
% in Theorem~\ref{thm:addweight_soundness}.
\begin{thm}[Soundness of the Weight Estimation]
 \label{thm:addweight_soundness}
 \vspace{-0.1cm}
For a program ${c}$ and its estimated weight set $\progW(c)$, for every  $(x^l, w) \in \traceW(c) $,
we have a corresponding estimated weight $(x^l, \hat{w}) \in \progW(c)$ and for every possible 
$\vtrace_0 \in \tdom_0(c),
v \in \mathbb{N}$,
if $\config{\vtrace_0, \hat{w}} \earrow v$,
then $v$ is an upper bound on ${w}(\trace_0)$. In symbols:
 %
\[
 \begin{array}{l}
 \forall c \in \cdom, x^l \in \lvar(c),w\in \tdom_0(c)\to \mathbb{N},\trace_0 \in \tdom_0(c), 
v \in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}, 
\\ \qquad
(x^l, w) \in \traceW(c) \st \Longrightarrow
\exists
(x^l, \hat{w}) \in \progW(c) 
\land
% \config{{c}, \trace_0} \to^{*} \config{\clabel{\eskip}^{l'}, \trace_0 \tracecat\vtrace} 
% \land 
\big(
 \config{\vtrace_0, \hat{w}} \earrow v \implies w(\trace_0) \leq v
\big)
\end{array}
\]
\end{thm}
Notice that $\hat{w} \in \constdom$ is an expression over symbols in $\constdom$. In particular, it may contain the input variables and so it may effectively be used as a function of the input - and capture loop bounds in terms of these inputs.
Also in this theorem, the evaluation $\config{\vtrace_0, \hat{w}} \earrow v$ is needed to obtain a concrete value $v$ from the symbolic weight $\hat{w}$ by specifying a value for the input variables via $\vtrace_0$.

% the estimated weight for $a^5$ is $k$, and this is a sound estimation.
% % in estimated dependency Graph as $k$ as well.
% For an arbitrary $\trace_0 \in \mathcal{T}_0(c)$, we know that $\config{\trace_0, k} \earrow \env(\trace_0) k$ and
% by the weight $w_k$ for the vertex $a^5$ (as in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(b)) we know 
% $w_k(\trace_0) = \env(\trace_0) k$.

\subsection{Adaptivity Upper Bound Computation}
\label{sec:alg_adaptcompute}
We estimate the adaptivity upper bound, 
$\progA(c)$ for a program $c$ as the maximal query length over all finite walks 
in its \emph{estimated dependency graph}, $\progG({c})$.
%where $\qlen$ and $\walks$ are defined in Section~\ref{sec:sematnic_adaptivity}.
%
% $\walks(\progG(c))$ represents the set of all finite walks on
%  $\progG({c})$.

\begin{defn}
[{Estimated Adaptivity}]
\label{def:prog_adapt}
{
Given a program ${c}$ and its estimated dependency graph 
$\progG({c})$
the estimated adaptivity for $c$ is 
\begin{center}
$
\progA({c})
\triangleq \max
\left\{ \qlen(k) \ \mid \  k \in \walks(\progG(c))\right \}.
$
\end{center}
}
\end{defn}

% The full definition for $\walks(\progG(c))$ and $\qlen$ over $\walks(\progG(c))$ are in the appendix.


Different from a walk on $\traceG(c)$, a walk $k \in \walks(\progG(c))$ on the graph $\progG(c)$
 does not rely on an initial trace. 
 The reason is that we use symbolic expressions over input variables, similarly to what we did for the weights in $\progW(c)$ in the previous section. Thus the adaptivity bound $\progA(c)$ will also be a symbolic arithmetic expression over the input variables. With this symbolic expression, we can prove the upper bound sound with respect to any initial trace. 

% We prove our estimated adaptivity is a sound upper bound of program's adaptivity in appendix.
%
\begin{thm}[Soundness of $\progA(c)$]
    \label{thm:sound_progadapt}
    For every program $c$, 
    its estimated adaptivity is a sound upper bound of its adaptivity.
\begin{center}
$
     \forall \trace_0 \in \tdom_{0}(c), v \in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\} \st 
\config{\progA(c), \trace_0} \earrow v \implies A(c)(\trace_0) \leq v.
$
\end{center}
\end{thm}

% \highlight{We have an algorithm $\pathsearch$ which 
% provides a tight upper bound on the estimated adaptivity. 
% \begin{thm}[Soundness of $\pathsearch$]
%   \label{thm:adaptalg_soundness}

% \begin{center}
% $
% \pathsearch(\progG({c})) \geq \progA(c).
% $
% \end{center}
% \end{thm}
% }
Symbolic expressions as used in the weight are great to express symbolic bounds but make the direct computation of 
a maximal walk harder. Specifically, to directly compute the estimated adaptivity $\progA$,
one has to traverse the estimated dependency graph.
A naive traversing strategy leads to non-termination
because the weight of each vertex in $\progG({c})$
is a symbolic expression containing input variables.
We could try to use a depth first search strategy
using the longest weighted path to approximate
the finite walk with the weight as
its visiting time. However, this approach would  consistently and considerably over-approximate the adaptivity. These challenges 
motivated us to develop an algorithm,   $\pathsearch$,  that provides a sound upper bound 
on $\progA$. 

\subsection{$\pathsearch$ Algorithm}

\subsubsection{$\pathsearch$ overview} 
% To address the two challenges we discussed above,  $\pathsearch$  combines
% Depth First Search and Breadth First Search. 
The idea of the $\pathsearch$ algorithm is to reduce the task of computing the
walk with the maximal query length in the dependency graph to the task of
finding the longest weighted path in a simplified dependency graph which happens to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
To get the simplified graph, the following steps are performed in $\pathsearch$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The original dependency graph is partitioned into  
  its strongly connected components (SCCs) using the standard Kosaraju’s algorithm. 
  %The SCCs are maximal strongly connected subgraphs. 
  \item  For each SCC, we compute a local adaptivity bound using an helper algorithm $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$, which we describe in the next section.
  \item  $\pathsearch$ shrinks the estimated dependency graph into a directed acyclic graph
  by reducing each SCC into a vertex with the weight equal to its adaptivity local bound.
\end{enumerate}
After simplifying the graph, $\pathsearch$ uses breadth first search  to find the longest
weighted path on this DAG and return this length as the adaptivity upper bound. Notice that the problem of computing the longest weighted path is in general unfeasible but since we are in a DAG the complexity is O(V+E) where $V$ and $E$ represent the number of vertices and the number of edges 
in the simplified graph. The pseudo-code for $\pathsearch$ can be found in the supplementary material\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. In }\DIFaddend the next section we present the helper algorithm $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$.

%% \remove{The idea of this algorithm is to reduce the task of computing the
%% walk with the maximal query length to the task of computing local versions of the adaptivity on the maximal strongly connected components of the graph $\progG(c)$ and then compose them into the program adaptivity. 
%% The algorithm  uses  
%% another algorithm $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$  recursively, which finds the {walk} for a strong connected component of $\progG(c)$. 
%% }

\subsubsection{Algorithm $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$}
The high level idea of $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$ is the following:
to provide an upper bound on the local adaptivity of an Strong Connected Component of a graph, 
we need to compute an upper bound on the maximal query length of walks in this SCC. 
For the sake of illustrating the algorithm, suppose we have an SCC with just three vertices $a^{3}_{1}$, $b^{2}_{0}$,
$c^{3}_{1}$, where $a$ and $c$ are query vertices with weight $3$ and $b$ is a standard assignment vertex with weight $2$. Suppose the SCC is a cycle with edge $a^{3}_{1} \to b^{2}_{0}$, $b^{2}_{0} \to c^{3}_{1}$ and $c^{3}_{1}\to a^{3}_{1}$. 
%
%% Suppose we have an SCC with just three vertices $a^{3}_{1}$, $b^{2}_{1}$,
%% $c^{3}_{0}$, where $a$ and $c$ are query vertices with weight $3$ and $b$ is a standard assignment vertex with weight $2$. Suppose the SCC is a cycle with edges here $a \to b$, $b \to c$ and $c \to a$.  
A walk with maximal query length is for instance: $a \to b \to c \to a \to b \to c \to a$. The query length of this walk is $5$ and it can be approximated by
 first finding a path which starts from a vertex and stops when it reaches the same vertex, such as $a \to b \to c \to a$. Then we can compute a sound upper bound by taking the product of 
 the minimal weight along the path ($\min(3,2,3,3)$) and the number of queries of this path\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend $3$ ($a$ and $c$ are query vertices). In this case, the upper bound is $6$.
Because we are
 traversing an SCC, if we start from one vertex, it will finally go back to the same vertex.   
 $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$ uses the above intuition and traverses an SCC starting from every possible
 vertex, keeps track of the minimal weight (line: 7 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}) and the number of queries (line: 8 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}) and 
 stops when it goes back to the same vertex (line: 11 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}). When a cycle is detected,
 the upper bound is updated (line: 12 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}) by taking the maximal between the current upper bound and the product of the minimal weight
 and the number of query vertices along the visited path as we discussed in the example above. When all the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{traverses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{traversals }\DIFaddend starting from 
 every vertex of this SCC are finished, the obtained upper bound will be the maximal approximated one. 
 The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{traverse }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{traversal }\DIFaddend is naturally performed by a Depth First Search, whose complexity is O(V+E), where $V$ and $E$ 
 represent the number of vertices and edges in this SCC.  $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$ performs such 
 a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{traverse }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{traversal }\DIFaddend for every vertex so the total complexity for $\pathsearch_{\kw{SCC}}$ is O((V+E)*V).

% The \emph{Adaptivity Computation Algorithm on An SCC ($\kw{\pathsearch_{scc}}$)}

This algorithm takes as input the program $c$ and a $\kw{SCC_i}$ of
$\progG(c)$, and outputs an adaptivity bound for $\kw{SCC_i}$. 
If $\kw{SCC_i}$ contains only one vertex, $x^l$ without any edge, $\kw{\pathsearch_{scc}}$ returns the query annotation of $x^l$ as the adaptivity.

recursively computes the adaptivity upper bound on the fly of paths collected through a DFS procedure $\kw{dfs}$ (lines: 4-13). This procedure guarantees that the visiting times of each vertex are upper bounded by its weight, and addresses the approximation challenge,
via two special lists parameters $\kw{flowcapacity}$ and $\kw{querynum}$ (lines:7-11).

 
$\kw{flowcapacity}$ is a list of symbolic expressions $\mathcal{A}_{in}$ which tracks the minimum weight
when searching a path,
and updates the weight when the path reaches a certain vertex\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. It }\DIFaddend guarantees that every vertex on the estimated walk is allowed to be visited at most $\kw{flowcapacity[v]}$ times, and this walk is a valid finite walk.
%
$\kw{querynum}$ is a list of integer
initialized with the value of the query annotation $\qflag_i(v)$ for every vertex. 
It tracks the total number of vertices with query annotation $1$
along the path. It guarantees that $\kw{flowcapacity[v] \times querynum[v]}$ computes an accurate query length
because $\kw{querynum[v]}$ is only the number of the vertices with query annotation $1$.
\DIFaddbegin 

\highlight{It is worth to stress that our algorithm can produce non-linear bounds for the adaptivity of a program. This is useful for example for programs  with 
nested while loops, such as $\kw{loop2VD}$ in Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp} in Section~\ref*{sec:implementation}. The program $\kw{loop2VD}$ includes a  nested while loop of the following form:
$$ \assign{j}{k}; \assign{i}{k}; \ewhile ~[j>0]~ \edo~ \big( \assign{j}{j-1}; ~\ewhile~[i > 0]~\edo~( \assign{i}{i-1}; ~\dots~)~\dots~ \big)  $$
The corresponding dependency graph contains an outside SCC corresponding to the outer loop, and inside this SCC, there 
exists an inner SCC corresponding to the inner loop. With the help of the reachability bound analysis, we can have linear bound as
the weight in SCCs, that is $k$ for both loops in the example. Then, using our Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptscc}, the inner SCC will be 
simplified as one vertex with weight $k$ and the bound for the outer SCC will become $k*k$.       }

% The $\THESYSTEM$ comes across an over-approximation due to its path-insensitive nature. 
The problem witnessed by this example occurs when the control flow is more sophisticated than what the static analysis can handle. 
$\kw{multiRoundsOdd}(k)$
has adaptivity $1 + k$ and a  while loop with two paths.
In each iteration, the queries $\clabel{\assign{y}{\query(\chi[x])}}^{5}$
and $\clabel{\assign{p}{\query(\chi[x])}}^{6}$ are based on the results of previous queries stored in $x$.
Only the query answer from $\clabel{\assign{y}{\query(\chi[x])}}^{5}$ in the first branch
is used in the query request command at line $7$, $\clabel{\assign{x}{\query(\chi(\ln(y)))} }^{7}$.
However, this branch is only executed in even iterations ($j = 0, 2, \cdots $).
From the semantics-based dependency graph in Figure~\ref{fig:multiRoundsOdd}(b),
% \footnote{We omit some edges which are constructed by the transition of $\flowsto$ relation
% for concise, but these edges exist
% in $\traceG(\kw{multiRoundsO(k)})$ because they can be constructed directly by $\vardep$ relation.
% These omissions don't affect the illustration and adaptivity computation.} 
the weight function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\lambda \trace_0 \st \env(\trace_0) \frac{k}{2}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \highlight{$\kw{lastVal}(\trace, \lceil  \frac{k}{2} \rceil  )$   }\DIFaddend for the vertex $y^5$ counts the
number of times $\clabel{\assign{y}{\query(\chi[x])}}^{5}$ is evaluated during the program execution under an initial trace \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\trace_0$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\trace$}\DIFaddend , i.e., half of the initial value of $k$ from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\trace_0$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\trace$}\DIFaddend .
However, {\THESYSTEM} fails to realize that all the odd iterations only execute the first branch
and that only even iterations execute the second branch. 
So it considers both branches for every iteration when estimating the adaptivity. 
In this sense, the weight estimated for $y^5$ and $p^6$ are both 
$k$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:multiRoundsOdd}(c).
As a result, {\THESYSTEM} computes $y^5  \to x^7  \to y^5  \to \cdots \to x^7 $
as the walk of maximal query length in Figure~\ref{fig:multiRoundsOdd}(c)
where each vertex is visited $k$ times, and so the estimated adaptivity is $1 + 2 * k$, instead of $1 + k$.

\DIFaddend \section{Implementation}
\DIFaddbegin \label{sec:implementation}
\DIFaddend % \subsection{The Implementation Evaluation Results }
% \label{sec:adapt-impleval}

\paragraph{Set Up}
We implemented $\THESYSTEM$ as a tool that takes a labeled command as input 
and outputs two upper bounds on the program adaptivity and the number of query requests, respectively.
This implementation consists of components for the 
abstract control flow graph generation,
the edge estimation, and the weight estimation in Ocaml, 
and of an implementation of the $\pathsearch$ algorithm in Python.
% The OCaml program takes the labeled command as input and outputs the program-based dependency graph and
% the abstract transition graph, which we
% feed into the Python program and the Python program provides the adaptivity upper bound and the query number \highlight{upper bound} as the final output.


\paragraph{Accuracy and Performance}
\input{eval-table}
We evaluate our implementation in terms of its accuracy and performance in estimating the adaptivity
through $25$ example programs (summary in Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp}).
For each example we compare the true accuracy with the estimated adaptivity, and we report the estimated number of queries, the L.O.C and the running time for the graph construction (graph), the weight estimation (weight) and the adaptivity computation ($\pathsearch$).
The set of examples includes the ones we have described before, such as two rounds $\kw{twoRounds(k)}$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(a) and multiple rounds $ \kw{mR(k)}$ and its variants $\kw{mROdd(k)}$ $\kw{mROdd(k)}$,
a logistic regression algorithm with gradient descent (short for $\kw{LRGD}$),
handcrafted programs from the $6^{th}$ ($\kw{seqRV}$) to $19^{th}$ ($\kw{loop2R}$) based on benchmarks from the work by Gulwani et al.~\cite{GulwaniJK09}. These examples have small sizes but complex structures to test the programs under different situations including
data \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dependency}\DIFaddend , control dependency, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the multiple paths nested loop with related counters, etc. The names of these programs obey the convention that,
$\kw{if}$ means there is an if control in the program;
$\kw{loop}$ means there is a while loop and $\kw{loop2}$ represents two levels nested loop in the program;
$\kw{C}$ denotes Control;
$\kw{D}$ for Dependency; $\kw{V}$ for Variable;
$\kw{M}$ for Multiple; $\kw{P}$ for Path and $\kw{R}$ for Related.
The last six programs are synthesized programs composed of the previous programs in order to test the performance limitation when the input program is large. 


In terms of accuracy, our tool provides a tight
upper bound on the adaptivity for the most \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of those }\DIFaddend examples. 
 For the $4^{th}$ program $\kw{mROdd(k)}$, $\THESYSTEM$ outputs an over-approximated upper bound 
 $2 + \max(1, 2k)$ because of the path-insensitive nature of the weight estimation algorithm, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:examples}. 
 Similarly for the $17^{th}$ example $\kw{loopM}$. 
$\THESYSTEM$ outputs $1 + \max(1, k) $ for the $5^{th}$ program $\kw{mRSingle(k)}$,  tight by our \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{adaptvitiy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{adaptivity }\DIFaddend definition (Definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt}).
However, Definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt} does not capture precisely the accuracy  of $\kw{mRSingle(k)}$,
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the result is still an over-approximation.

In terms of performance, our tool can quickly construct the graph, estimate the weight,
and provide the adaptivity upper bound for the first $19$ examples. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, when it comes to complicated examples with multiple high-level nest loops such as $tRCom$ (two $2-$level and three single-level while loops), $jumbo$ (one $2-$level and two single-level while loops) and $big$ (two $3-$level, three $2-$level and one single-level while loops),
our tool can not handle them. The performance bottleneck is the reachability bound analysis algorithm used to compute the weights.
We can see how the time grows dramatically from $85.9$ seconds for the $20^{th}$ example $mR(k,N)$ with only one $3-$level nest while loop,
to $5104$ seconds ($85$ minutes) for the $21^{th}$ example $\kw{mRCom}$ who has two $3-$level nested while loops. 
Notice, that even though the example $\kw{seqCom}$ has the largest size of $502$ lines 
of code, our tool can still quickly handle it because $\kw{seqCom}$ does not have loops. Fortunately, examples with many nested loops are not common in the data analysis area. 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \highlight{ $\THESYSTEM$ uses only one second
for the example $\kw{seqCom}$ with the largest size of $502$ lines 
of code. However, when it comes to examples with complex nested loops such as $tRCom$ (two $2-$level and three single-level while loops), $jumbo$ (one $2-$level and two single-level while loops) and $big$ (two $3-$level, three $2-$level and one single-level while loops),
$\THESYSTEM$ will timeout.  In Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp}, we denote the timeout of these three examples by $*$. 
The performance bottleneck is the reachability bound analysis algorithm used in $\THESYSTEM$.}

% \remove{We first evaluate our implementation in terms of its accuracy and performance in estimating the adaptivity
% To do this we consider {through} $23$ example programs with the evaluation results shown in  Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp}.
% We show the accuracy of our tool by the adapativity, the estimated adaptivity and query number upper bound $A_{est}$ and $query\#$ of these $23$ examples,

% upper bound for the total number of query requests in the program. And the last column is the performance evaluation w.r.t. the program size in terms of lines of code.
% The performance evaluation contains three parts. The first part is the running time of the Ocaml code, which parses the program and generates the $\progG(c)$.
% The second and third parts are the running times of the reachability bound analysis algorithm

% \remove{The examples show a wide range of values for their adaptivity.

% $\THESYSTEM$ computes tight adaptivity bound for the first three examples.
% The third example is a logistic regression algorithm with gradient decent (short for LRGD).
% For the fourth program $\kw{mROdd(k)}$, $\THESYSTEM$ outputs an over-approximated upper bound $2 + \max(1, 2k)$ 
% % for the $A(c)$, which is consistent with our expectation 
% because of the path insensitive nature of the weight estimation algorithm, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:examples}. 
% The $5^{th}$ program, $\kw{mRSingle(k)}$ is the example program in Fig.~\ref{ex:multiRoundsS}.
% $\THESYSTEM$ outputs $1 + \max(1, k) $, which is tight with respect to our adaptvitiy definition in Def.~\ref{def:trace_adapt}.
% However, because Def.~\ref{def:trace_adapt} is a loose definition of $\kw{mRSingle(k)}$'s actual adaptivity rounds,
% the result is still an over-approximation.}

\paragraph{Effectiveness Evaluation}
\input{eval-table-generalization}
In our last evaluation, we consider the effectiveness of {\THESYSTEM} in terms of reducing the generalization error of real-world data analysis programs.
%  from Sklearn machine learn benchmark sets and research paper~\cite{Jamieson2015TheAO}.
We do this by considering a set of benchmarks including 
nine classical data analyses taken from examples in Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp} instantiated with various parameters,
four programs implementing the algorithms from~\cite{Jamieson2015TheAO}
and four data analysis programs 
from \hyperlink{https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/examples}{sklearn}~\cite{SklearnBenchmark} benchmark.
% 7 machine learning programs

% and \hyperlink{https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch}{pytorch}~\cite{PytorchBenchmark}
% benchmarks.
% The 15 data analysis programs 
% from sklearn benchmark includes 12 programs with $O(n)$-adaptivity rounds
% and 3 programs with $O(n*m)$-adapvitiy rounds.
% % for the database classification.
% These $O(n)$-rounds adaptivity programs are
% the
% implementations of the decision tree, logistic regression, naive Gaussian inference classifiers
% with $O(n)$ fitting depth,
% and the grid search hyperparameter selecting algorithm for each classifier with 
% hyperparameter space of constant size $c$.
% The $O(n*m)$-rounds adaptivity programs are
% the implementations of the decision tree, logistic regression, naive Gaussian inference models equipped with one v.s. rest model with $O(n)$ fitting depth for classifying the dataset with $O(m)$ classes.
% These programs are evaluated for classifying a demography dataset from 
% the USA census database~\cite{CensusDatabase}.
{We use acronyms for these programs to describe the analyses they perform and fit the evaluation summary in a single table. We use LR for logistic regression, GD for gradient descent, mR for multiple round, DT for decisionTree, RQ for repeatedQuery, OVR for one-vs-rest, De for degree, Dim for dimension, Pair for pairwise. Similarly, we shorten the mechanisms: GS for Gaussian, DS for Data Split,
TS for ThresholdOut.  }

For each program, we show in Table~\ref{tb:adapt-generalization} the
generalization errors when running without a mechanism and running
with different mechanisms over uniformly generated training data.  The
average generalization error of each program is measured by
root-mean-square error (rmse).  The root-mean-square error without any
mechanism is shown in column ``None''. 
We mark the best rmse in red.
We mark in bold the rmse
produced by the mechanism chosen by {\THESYSTEM} using the following
heuristics.  According to Theorem~\ref{thm:nonadapt-adapt},\ref{thm:gaussiannoise},
\ref{thm:gaussiannoise2},
we compare the value of $\sqrt{\query \#}$ and
$\progA\sqrt{\log(\query \#)}$ and choose DataSplit if
$\sqrt{\query \#} \gg \progA\sqrt{\log(\query \#)}$ and Gaussian
mechanism if $\sqrt{\query \#} \ll \progA\sqrt{\log(\query \#)}$ and
Thresholdout mechanism if these two quantities are close. 
 It is worth
stressing that these are rough heuristics since we are omitting the
constants hidden in these theorems. We leave the problem to identify
the best heuristic to future work.

%% In short, all these data analysis programs behave overfitting when running over randomly generated data sets. 
%% To obtain good data analysis result with low generalization error,
%% one needs to run programs multiple times with different mechanisms.
%% This takes much longer time than just training a data analysis program with one run.
%% However, by using our tool in the first step, an analyst can directly equip the program with a chosen mechanism to get good
%% analysis results.

    According to our heuristics, our examples fall into three categories: 
    $\progA$ is much larger than $\query \#$, $\progA$ is close to  $\query \#$,
    and $\progA$ is much smaller than $\query \#$. 
    Since both $\progA$ and $\query \#$ are symbolic, the decision of our heuristics relies on 
    the instantiation of input parameters such as $k,m, n$. To better evaluate our heuristics, we present two different instantiations $k,m,n=10$ and $k,m, n =1000$ so that
    for the same example, our tool will choose different mechanisms.

We can see in Table~\ref{tb:adapt-generalization} that the mechanism
chosen by our heuristics (marked in bold) is the best in most cases.
In the setting of small parameters $k,m,n=10$, our heuristics
choose most of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{times }\DIFaddend ThresholdOut. Exceptions are examples such as $\kw{DTOVR}$,
$\kw{LROVR}$
from \hyperlink{https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/examples}{sklearn}~\cite{SklearnBenchmark}
benchmark, and $\kw{RQ}$ from~\cite{Jamieson2015TheAO}, for which our tool
chooses the Gaussian mechanism.  In the setting of large parameters
$k,m,n=1000$, 
for most examples our tool chooses the Gaussian mechanism.
For $\kw{twoRounds}$, our heuristics suggest the DataSplit mechanism. For examples $\kw{lilUCB}$,
$\kw{nDPair}$ and $\kw{bestArm}$ from~\cite{Jamieson2015TheAO} within
the \emph{Guess and Check}~\cite{RogersRSSTW20} framework, our tool chooses the Thresholdout mechanism.

%% \remove{We first evaluate example programs from Table~\ref{tb:adapt-imp} as the baseline evaluation to show that our tool can choose the mechanism that performs best in reducing the generalization error as we claimed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Related Work and Conclusion %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\section{Related Work}

% \dg{Please cite adaptive Fuzz, and explain how its adaptivity analysis differs from ours.}

%In terms of techniques, our work relies on ideas from both static analysis and dynamic analysis. We discuss closely related work in both areas.

\paragraph{Dependency Definitions and Analysis} 
There is a vast literature on dependency definitions and dependency analysis. 
We consider a semantics definition of dependencies which consider (intraprocedural) data and control dependency~\cite{bilardi1996framework,cytron1991efficiently,pollock1989incremental}.    
Our definition is inspired by classical works on traditional dependency analysis~\cite{DenningD77} and noninterference~\cite{GoguenM82a}.
Formally, our definition is similar to the one by \citet{Cousot19a}, which also identifies dependencies by considering differences in two execution traces. 
However, Cousot excludes some forms of implicit dependencies, e.g. the ones generated by empty observations,  which instead we consider. 
%
Common tools to study dependencies are dependency graphs~\cite{ferrante1987program}. We use here a semantics-based approach to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{generating the }\DIFaddend dependency graph similar, for example, to works by \citet{austin1992dynamic}, \citet{hammer2006dynamic} and \cite{mastroeni2008data}.
%propose ways of constructing different kinds of program slices, by choose different program 
%DDGs have been used in many other domains. \citet{nagar2018automated} use DDGs to find serializability violations. dependency. 
% For example, in either syntactic or semantics sense.
% This abstract dependency is based on properties rather than exact data.
% Aims to give finer and smaller program slice. 
%They actually use a combination of  
%static and dynamic dependency graphs but in a manner that is different from how we use the two. Their slicing uses both static and dynamic dependency graphs, while we use the dynamic dependency graph as the basis of a definition, which is then soundly approximated by an analysis based on the static dependency graph.}
%\paragraph{Static program analysis} 
%Our algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm} is influenced by previous works in static analysis related to effect systems, control-flow analysis, and data-flow analysis. 
%The idea of statically estimating a sound upper bound for the adaptivity from the semantics is indirectly inspired from prior work on cost analysis via effect systems~\cite{cciccek2017relational,radivcek2017monadic,qu2019relational}. The idea of defining adaptivity using data flow is inspired by the work of graded Hoare logic~\cite{gaboardi2021graded}, which reasons about data flows as a resource. 
%
Our approach shares some similarities with the use of dependency graphs in works analyzing dependencies between events, e.g. in event programming. \citet{memon2007event} uses an event-flow graph, representing all the possible event interactions, where vertices are GUI event edges represent pairs of events that can be performed immediately one after the other. In a similar way, we use edges to track the may-dependence between variables looking at all the possible interactions. 
% of one variable with respect to another variable. The main difference is in the way the graph is constructed. {\THESYSTEM} relies on the structure of the target program, while the event-flow model only considers the event type.
\citet{arlt2012lightweight} use a weighted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{edges }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{edge }\DIFaddend indicating a dependency between two events, e.g. one event possibly reads data written by the other event, with the weight showing the intensity of the dependency (the quantity of data involved). We also use weights but on vertices and with different meaning, they are functions describing the number of times the vertices can be visited given an initial state.

Differently from all these previous works, we use a dependency graph with quantitative information needed to identify the length of chain of dependencies. Our weight estimation is inspired by  works in complexity analysis and WCET. 
Specifically, it is inspired by works on  reachability-bound analysis using program abstraction and invariant inference~\cite{GulwaniZ10, SinnZV17,GulwaniJK09} and work on invariant inference through cost equations and ranking functions~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,AlbertAGP08,AliasDFG10,Flores-MontoyaH14}.

% or a combination of
% In general, these techniques give the approximated upper bound of the program's total running time or resource cost.
% However, they failed to consider the case where the cost -- the adaptivity-- could decrease when there isn't a dependency relation between variables.
\paragraph{Generalization in Adaptive Data Analysis}
Starting from the works by \citet{DworkFHPRR15} and \citet{HardtU14}, several works have designed methods that ensure generalization for adaptive data analyses~\cite{dwork2015reusable,dwork2015generalization,BassilyNSSSU16,UllmanSNSS18,FeldmanS17,jung2019new,SteinkeZ20,RogersRSSTW20}.
Several of these works drew inspiration from differential privacy, a notion of formal data privacy. By limiting the influence that an individual can have on the result of a data analysis, even in adaptive settings, differential privacy can also be used to limit the influence that a specific data sample can have on the statistical validity of a data analysis. This connection is actually in two directions, as discussed for example by \citet{YeomGFJ18}.
%
Considering this connection between generalization and privacy, it is not surprising that some of the works on programming language techniques for privacy-preserving data analysis are related to our work. 
Adaptive Fuzz~\cite{Winograd-CortHR17} is a programming framework for differential privacy that is designed around the concept of adaptivity. 
This framework is based on a typed functional language that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distinguish }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distinguishes }\DIFaddend between several forms of adaptive and non-adaptive composition theorem with the goal of achieving better upper bounds on the privacy cost. Adaptive Fuzz uses a type system and some partial evaluation to guarantee that the programs respect differential privacy. However, it does not include any technique to bound the number of rounds of adaptivity. 
\citet{lobo2021programming} propose a language for differential privacy where one can reason about the accuracy of programs in terms of confidence intervals on the error that the use of differential privacy can generate. These are akin to bounds on the generalization error. This language is based on a static analysis which however cannot handle adaptivity. 
%
The way we formalize the access to the data mediated by a mechanism is a reminiscence of how the interaction with an oracle is modeled in the verification of security properties. As an example, the recent works by \citet{BarbosaBGKS21} and \citet{AguirreBGGKS21} use different techniques to track the number of accesses to an oracle. However, reasoning about the number of accesses is easier than estimating the adaptivity of these calls, as we do instead here.

% together with guarantees on their accuracy? 
% {The first important application of the differential privacy concept started from the work by \cite{DworkFHPRR15}}, which applied this concept into guaranteeing the generalization error of adaptive data analysis. 

% Previous works on reducing the risk of spurious scientific discoveries are under the assumption that a fixed collection of learning algorithms to be applied are selected non-adaptively before seeing the data. In contrast with them, they developed this work under the adaptive data analysis settings. They formalized the generalization error for adaptive data analysis and then presented their validation guarantees.
% Concretely, they proposed the famous transfer theorem.
% And based on this theorem, they proved high probabilistic bounds on the generalization error for $\epsilon$- and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private adaptive data analysis as well as adaptive analysis with statistic and non-statistic queries.
% These works connected the theory with the practice of data analysis, which in my perspective, is the most significant and interesting contribution of this paper. 
% %
% % At the end, they presented the application of applying concrete differentially private techniques into adaptive data analysis.

% {This extension from differential privacy to adaptive data analysis made significant progress in reducing the overfitting risks in practical works (i.e. the data analysis in adaptive setting). Further works on improving these probabilistic bounds, guaranteeing the generalization error such as \cite{dwork2015generalization}, \cite{BassilyNSSSU16}, \cite{dwork2015reusable}, \cite{jung2019new} etc. are all influenced by this work.}

% {Following all previous works on preserving the statistical validity in adaptive data analysis, \cite{smith2017information} made a survey.}
% This survey started from giving formal and clear introduction to the concept of adaptive data analysis.
%  % by giving formal definitions of the concepts and clear representations and notations. 
% Then, it summarized the probability bounds on the generalization error w.r.t. the true population when applying different mechanisms in numeric adaptive data analysis.
% The mechanisms includes split data with adaptivity, adding Gaussian noise with specific standard derivation, adopting differentially private algorithms etc.
% Next, he extended the scope onto the non-numeric adaptive data analysis and presented the corresponding probabilistic bounds based on the information measures. 

% {This survey was developed in an easy-to-understand way and included a thorough knowledge on state-of-the-art works on adaptive data analysis, which helped me to sort out the results from existing works and relations between them.}

% {Following the same line of work, \cite{jung2019new} gave a new analysis on the role of differential privacy in adaptive data analysis.}
% They gave a substantially better probability bounds on differential privacy's generalization guarantee based on a new proof technique of the transfer theorem (initially from \cite{dwork2015generalization}). 

% The key point in their proof technique is looking into the posterior distributions, which is an insightful new perspective on proving the generalization error bound. This new perspective also brought a better understanding in the specific reason of analysis overfitting and the role of differential privacy in adaptive data analysis. This new technique I think will be fruitful in future work.
% %  based on my personal interests on the posterior distribution analysis
% % Another very meaningful structural insight inspired by this paper is the role of differential privacy and sample accuracy. This is pointed to the end of the paper that the sample accuracy serves to guarantee that the reported answers are close to their posterior means and differential privacy serves to guarantee that the posterior means are close to their true answers.

% % There are also some interesting works on further improving the accuracy bound unresolved in this paper, such as replace the Markov-like dependence with a Chernoff-like dependence. I'm deeply interested in making contributions on it.

% % {Based on all the excellent theory works on guaranteeing the statistical validity of adaptive data analysis, I started to think from the perspective of the programming language.}
% {Existing works on adaptive data analysis are trying to improve the probabilistic bounds for generalization error in terms of the adaptive and non-adaptive queries numbers and size of the data sample on pen-and-paper proofs.
% However, we still cannot guarantee implementations of the corresponding algorithms adhere to this generalization error bounds.
% Given an arbitrary data analysis program, we are unable to tell its generalization error. So in my consideration, verifying the programs' generalization error would be a possible interesting research direction. Furthermore, since the size of the data sample can be determined by the input or the users, then the most interesting and challenging point would be figuring out the program's adaptive query numbers. 
% This motivated us to look into the verification of algorithms' adaptivity, in order to formally verifiy their generalization error.}

% \paragraph{Data analysis} There is a significant amount of work on programming for data analysis. Many popular platforms are based on the R language\cite{ihaka1996r, marcon2021orchestrating}. Jaql is a declarative scripting language for large-scale data analysis\cite{beyer2011jaql}.

% This new approach based on static analysis on bytecode of the applications, 
% giving a precisely defined dependency between a fixed number of events in event sequence.
% Then, they inferred a finer Event Dependency graph, aims to give a better lightweight static analysis on applications.
