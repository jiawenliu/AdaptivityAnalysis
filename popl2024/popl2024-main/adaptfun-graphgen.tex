We now have all the elements to construct the estimated dependency graph of a program.
\begin{defn}
[Estimated Dependency Graph]
\label{def:prog_graph}
Given a program $c$ 
with the feasible data flow relation $\flowsto(x^i, y^j, c)$ for every $x^i, y^j \in \lvar(c)$, 
and reachability-bound, $\absclr(e, c)$ for every edge $e \in \absE(c)$ on the abstract transition graph,
the estimated dependency graph of $c$ has four components:
\[\progG(c) = (\progV(c), \progE(c), \progW(c), \progF(c))\]
each of the four components is generated as follows.
{\small
\[
\begin{array}{lll}
\progV & := & \left\{ 
x^l
~ \middle\vert ~
x^l \in \lvar(c)
\right\}
\\
\progE & := & 
\left\{ 
(x^i, y^j) 
~ \middle\vert ~
\begin{array}{l}
x^i, y^j \in \vertxs
\land
\exists n \in \mathbb{N}, z_1^{r_1}, \ldots, z_n^{r_n} \in \lvar(c) \st
n \geq 0 \land
\\
\flowsto(y^j, z_1^{r_1}, c) 
\land \ldots \land \flowsto(z_n^{r_n}, x^i, c) 
\end{array}
\right\}
\\
\progW & := &
\left\{ (x^l, \hat{w}) 
\mid
x^l \in \progV(c) 
\land 
\hat{w} = 
\sum\left\{ \absclr(e, c) \middle\vert e \in \absE(c) \land e = (l, \_, \_) \right\}
\right\}
\\
\progF & := & 
\left\{(x^l, n) 
% \in \lvar(c) \times \{0, 1\} 
~ \middle\vert ~
\begin{array}{l}
 x^l \in \lvar(c) \land
 n = 1 \Leftrightarrow x^l \in \qvar(c)
\land n = 0 \Leftrightarrow x^l \notin \qvar(c)
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{array}
\] }
\end{defn}
The estimated dependency graph provides essentially estimated dependencies between variables and upper bounds on the number of times each  command is executed. The  path-searching algorithm presented in the next section, which connects all the information we need in the static analysis dependency graph and provides us with a sound estimation of adaptivity.
As in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview-example}(c), the estimated dependency graph for
running example is tight in terms of both edges and weights.
