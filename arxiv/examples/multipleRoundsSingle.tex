\begin{example}[Over-Defined Adaptivtiy Example]
    \label{ex:multiRoundsS}
    The program's adaptivity definition in our formal model,
    (in Definition~\ref{def:trace_adapt})
     comes across an over-approximation on capturing the program's intuitive adaptivity rounds.
    It is resulted from the difference between its weight calculation and the \emph{variable may-dependency} definition.
    It occurs when the weight is computed over the traces different from the traces used in 
    witnessing the \emph{variable may-dependency} relation.
    
    The program $\kw{multiRoundsS(k)}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:multiRoundsS}(a) demonstrates this over-approximation.
    It is a variant of the multiple rounds strategy with input $k$.
    In each iteration the query $\query(\chi[y] + p)$ in command $7$ is based on previous query results stored in $p$ and $y$.
    Differ from Example~\ref{ex:multipleRounds},
    only the query answer from the one iteration, the $(k - 2)^{th}$ one is used in query request
    $\clabel{\assign{p}{\query(\chi[y]+p)} }^{7}$.
    Because the execution will reset
    $p$'s value by the constant $0$ in all the other iterations
    at line $10$ after this query request.
    In this way, all the query answers stored in $p$ is erased and isn't used
    in the query request at next iteration, except the one at the $(k - 2)$th iteration.
    In this sense, the intuitive \emph{adaptivity} rounds for this example is $2$. 
    However, our adaptivity definition fails to realize that there is only dependency relation 
    between $p^7$ and $p^7$ in one single iteration, 
    but not in all the others. 
    As shown in the semantics-based dependency graph in Figure~\ref{fig:multiRoundsS}(b), 
    there is an edge from $p^7$ to itself representing the existence of \emph{Variable May-Dependency} from $p^7$ on itself,
    and the visiting times of labeled variable $p^7$ is 
    $w_{}(\trace_0)$. $w_{}(\trace_0)$ will count the execution times of command $\clabel{\assign{p}{\query(\chi[y]+p)} }^{7}$ during execution, which is expected to be equal to the loop iteration numbers, i.e., initial value of input $k$ from the initial trace $\trace_0$.
    As a result, the walk with the longest query length 
    is
    $p^7  \to \cdots \to p^7 \to y^4  \to z^1 $ with the vertex $p^7$ visited $w_{p^7}(\trace_0)$, as the dotted arrows. 
    The adaptivity based on this walk
    is $2 + w_{p^7}(\trace_0)$, instead of $2$. 
    Though the $\THESYSTEM$ is able to give us $2 + k$,  as an accurate bound w.r.t this definition.
